00:00:04.625 --> 00:00:06.166
Korrine: Where I'm at now?

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:10.416
You know, I'll admit I get stuck
in certain spots where, you know,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.500
something will trigger a memory
and be like, “wow, that stinks,” you know?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.000
And it's tough because it's hard to move
past that when you get something like,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.875
for example, going to the eye doctor
and hearing more bad news, like,

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:26.250
you know, “no, you're
never going to be able to drive.”

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.000
That's a very hard thing to hear.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.416
[music plays]

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:40.000
Rebecca: What's difficult in a community like this
is that when we work from a medical model

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.625
and we look at DeafBlindness,

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:47.041
there creates this tremendous sense of fear

00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:52.041
and a tremendous sense of inner turmoil
and conflict within the community,

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:55.625
because everybody is looking
for treatment or a cure

00:00:55.625 --> 00:00:57.541
for their type of Usher syndrome.

00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:00.500
You know, I'm 43 now,
I was told when I was about 15

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.166
that there would be
treatment in ten years.

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:04.625
I've been told this for...

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:07.125
...since I was 15.

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:12.500
And so along the way,
I had my own struggle with having to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.166
play with hope and really,
you know, hang on every word

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:20.250
that these researchers and scientists
and clinicians would tell us.

00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:24.625
Korrine: It's hard to have
somebody try and understand

00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:28.500
what you're going through
if they're not actually going through it.

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:33.666
I mean, physically,
you can't put somebody in my shoes.

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:35.750
Obviously, I wouldn't
wish this upon anybody.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.416
I wouldn't want anyone to experience this.

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:41.291
Rebecca: The medical community,
I think, are very well-intended,

00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:45.750
but they're also incredibly careless
with the messaging, with the language.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
That going deaf
and blind is something to be feared,

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:51.416
that we're doing everything
we can to stop it.

00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:54.166
It makes me weepy,
I don't even know why.

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:55.916
It's good, though,
because I think it's important

00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:58.375
for people to see this.
And what makes me weepy is...

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:05.458
Every doctor appointment
that someone goes to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.916
is a guaranteed failure.

00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:11.000
It's how much more you've lost.

00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:15.375
It’s all the people around you
and what they're hoping for and expecting.

00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:20.000
You feel all that pressure
and you measure things so clinically:

00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:24.125
what your degrees of vision are,
what your color vision is like.

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:28.083
And we never talked
about the mental health.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.500
And I cry now like almost for my younger
self, but for all of these people...

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:35.500
for years and years, I've said

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.000
to all of these foundations,
we need to talk about the mental health.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.625
The more we focus
on the clinical aspects of it,

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:45.750
the more we walk towards

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.750
being flawed, being broken,
needing to be fixed

00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:51.750
and the less we talk about being human

00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:55.416
and the less we talk
about what it feels like to be alive,

00:02:55.916 --> 00:02:59.916
what it means to create
meaning and fulfillment in your life.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.833
And the less we give
ourselves space to mourn,

00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:06.375
to grieve, to...

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:10.541
...to be someone who is living with
something that is very challenging

00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:16.500
in a world that is not created or built for
people who are not able to see or hear.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.500
And so my mission as one person

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.791
is to really shine light
on the mental health aspect,

00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:28.875
because that's the only thing
I have control over.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:29.875
Korrine: It is hard.

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:32.416
It's still hard because this
is my reality. Medical stuff

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:36.375
can always change and evolve,
but this is where I'm at right now.

00:03:36.541 --> 00:03:38.875
And you know,
I've had to come to terms with that.

00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:40.750
And it's hard.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.125
It's really hard.

00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:45.666
But I'm grateful
for everything that I've learned

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:49.875
and all the tools that I have
and assistive technology and the support.

00:03:50.125 --> 00:03:51.625
It helps. It helps a lot.

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:55.625
Because I don't think I would be
as strong as I am without that,

00:03:55.625 --> 00:04:00.375
and I don't think I would be as good
of an advocate as I am, without that.

00:04:00.375 --> 00:04:04.000
Rebecca: We are at this pivotal moment
where I think, sadly,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.166
Covid really sort of spotlighted
mental health for so many people.

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:11.916
I think that within the DeafBlind world,
it was sort of interesting

00:04:11.916 --> 00:04:14.791
that when Covid happened
and everything started to shut down,

00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:18.500
it was like I remember a lot of
my DeafBlind people would say,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.625
“now you know what it feels like,” you know,
of not being able to go out in the world

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:27.250
and do the things that you're so
accustomed to easily doing or wanting to do.

00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:32.416
And I think that to be able
to now have mental health

00:04:32.416 --> 00:04:36.250
be more at the forefront in
the mainstream world has really allowed it

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.250
to become more of the forefront
for even the DeafBlind community.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.250
And I'm so greatful for that.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.166
