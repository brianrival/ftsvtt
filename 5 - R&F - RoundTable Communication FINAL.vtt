00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.125
Scott: It's really changed a lot
over the years for me

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:08.000
in terms of communicating with family.

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:10.958
A lot of that, I think, has to do with

00:00:10.958 --> 00:00:14.250
heir acceptance of me
as a DeafBlind person.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.750
And, you know, it was a struggle
for my family to accept that

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.375
and to figure out adaptations for me.

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:25.291
I think in a lot of ways I just really
weren't sure what to do or how to act.

00:00:25.916 --> 00:00:27.750
[music plays]

00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:35.875
Scott: That's always been kind of a struggle,

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:40.166
getting even my closest family
and relatives to understand

00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:42.416
my communication needs
are changing and

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:45.916
my intent is just to be included,
just to be an equal.

00:00:45.916 --> 00:00:47.666
More recently,

00:00:47.666 --> 00:00:50.416
they've been better
about using my FM system

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:55.166
or texting me, but it's
still a challenge, you know, because

00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:57.416
there’s a sense of feeling left out,

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:01.875
because not everybody
takes the time to use the FM system.

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:05.791
Not everybody wants to
take the time to communicate.

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:07.625
We have to find a middle ground.

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:11.375
We have to find a way
that might not be the most ideal

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:15.208
for everybody, but it does
allow for communication.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.125
Nathalie: When I communicate
with my family,

00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:22.250
we like to listen

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.500
to music and talk over the music.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.875
And that makes it very hard for me
to understand and know what's going on.

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:35.791
So sometimes I would whisper

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.875
to my parents or whoever
is sitting next to me,

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:45.583
and say, “what’s going on,
what are they talking about?”

00:01:45.583 --> 00:01:47.125
I do want to be part of it.

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:51.333
And they understand that it's hard

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:54.666
to hear people talking all at once or

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:56.750
in a loud sound.

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:03.500
I tell them what I need you to do,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.500
to speak up or

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.791
to speak slow or whatever it is.

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:13.000
That way they can communicate with me.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.416
But there are times when they forget.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.750
And I have to repeat,
and it is okay to repeat.

00:02:21.416 --> 00:02:23.416
Sometimes what I do is

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:26.291
I kind of let go

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:29.375
and let them have the conversation.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.916
And if they want to talk to me,

00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:38.166
then I will have a separate conversation
with my family member.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.458
Chris: That is a common theme
in the deaf experience.

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:46.541
As conversations get more heated or happen
quickly and become hard to follow

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.166
we're told, “we'll tell you
later, it's not important.

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:50.750
Don't worry about it”

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.166
or, “we're just talking about this.”

00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:55.916
Adriana, you can relate, exactly.

00:02:56.666 --> 00:03:00.041
Again, not uncommon in our community.

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:03.000
I used to lean on my mother
a lot, to interpret

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.125
the conversations around us.

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:07.625
And when I couldn't follow a conversation,

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:10.916
she was the one who made sure
to explain what was going on.

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:13.000
And she would voice for me sometimes.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.916
And my sister Lisa has now

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:17.375
taken up that role in our family.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.916
While both my sisters can sign,

00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:24.875
having more than just
superficial conversations is difficult.

00:03:24.875 --> 00:03:28.875
So instead, what we
sometimes do is use a group text.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:31.500
We can all participate
in the conversation through text

00:03:32.041 --> 00:03:35.500
Interestingly, the way
we communicate has evolved.

00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:38.250
For one, my mother,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.375
who was by far the most
fluent signer in our family,

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:43.125
sadly has Alzheimer's.

00:03:43.416 --> 00:03:46.291
She would never be able
to be a part of our group texts.

00:03:46.916 --> 00:03:50.250
Using technology to communicate with her
is just not an option.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.500
So we will bring an interpreter

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.375
so that I can have a conversation
with her directly.

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:59.041
And that's the challenge
that I'm facing with my family right now.

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:03.500
Adriana: Communication
in my family is not great.

00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:05.875
It's pretty similar to Chris’ experience.

00:04:06.125 --> 00:04:09.541
I'll see my family talking around me
and they'll always say,

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:12.166
“we’ll tell you later.” It's the same old story.

00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:16.125
It's a very common
thing amongst DeafBlind people.

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:20.375
I'm always honest with my family
about what my needs are.

00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:23.291
I need to use tactile sign language.

00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:25.291
I can't read their lips any longer.

00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:28.666
I can't even see sign language
at a distance.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.000
And that's tough.

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:32.125
I have struggled through

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:36.375
to get to my family to open their minds
and respect my communication needs.

00:04:36.625 --> 00:04:38.875
But I will say my mom has been great.

00:04:39.125 --> 00:04:42.166
She always signs and interprets for me,

00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:44.583
but she's not always there to rely on.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.041
Thankfully, my children
do interpret for me whenever it's needed,

00:04:49.041 --> 00:04:52.166
but I don't always want to
rely on them all the time.

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:53.916
So that's a challenge for me.

00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:57.916
I want to socialize with
family members at family parties

00:04:57.916 --> 00:04:59.500
when we're sitting around the table.

00:04:59.875 --> 00:05:04.166
Unfortunately, I can't even see who
they are to identify them.

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:06.666
I can't see the foods that are
presented in front of me.

00:05:06.666 --> 00:05:09.791
I can't hear and I can't read their lips.

00:05:09.791 --> 00:05:11.666
I can't even see signing.

00:05:11.666 --> 00:05:14.625
I'm often very isolated at these events.

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:16.125
I'm often left out.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.500
Now, my daughter might be dancing
and hanging out with cousins

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.625
and she'll run over and sign tactilely
to let me know quickly what's going on.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:28.375
And another thing that's great
is that my cousin Tony

00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:32.416
also knowssign language,
and she will sign tactilely with me.

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:38.000
But it's still really challenging
for me to interact with most of my family.

00:05:38.208 --> 00:05:41.458
I just wish that they would learn
to respect my need

00:05:41.458 --> 00:05:45.458
for communication access
as a way to show their love and support.

00:05:45.458 --> 00:05:46.250
[music plays]

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.041
It's not easy, but I do have
hope that one day it'll get better

00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:55.166
for all DeafBlind people
and their relationships with their families.

00:05:58.875 --> 00:06:02.750
