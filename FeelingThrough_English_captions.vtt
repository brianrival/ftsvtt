[gentle music]

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:51.887

00:00:57.851 --> 00:00:59.436
Oh!

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.646
You give me the money, I'm stunting it out.

00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:02.814
I'm chilling it out.

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:04.274
With my boy, Tereek.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.817
And my boy, J.R.

00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:07.569
We chillin' in the streets.

00:01:09.237 --> 00:01:10.197
You get a whole bottle.

00:01:10.822 --> 00:01:11.740
When you really think about it.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.033
50 cents for a drink...

00:01:14.117 --> 00:01:15.327
That's kind of weird.

00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:17.454
Come on, J.R.

00:01:25.879 --> 00:01:26.755
Chill! Chill!

00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:28.256
We can go again.

00:01:28.256 --> 00:01:29.382
- You always take this too serious.

00:01:29.382 --> 00:01:30.550
I'm not being serious.   -We're just playing.

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:41.686
Again?

00:01:41.686 --> 00:01:42.604
Who dat?

00:01:42.938 --> 00:01:43.939
My mom.

00:01:44.523 --> 00:01:45.315
Okay.

00:01:45.857 --> 00:01:46.858
I said, okay. Okay.

00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:48.026
Alright, bye.

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:50.070
Yo, that was my Momma Dukes.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.612
I gotta bounce, bro.

00:01:50.612 --> 00:01:52.489
She was yelling at me through the phone.

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:53.281
- Tell me about it.

00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:54.658
I've got like five missed calls already.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.327
We out.   -I gotta go home too.

00:01:57.828 --> 00:01:58.662
Be safe, bro.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.538

Can you spare...   -I ain't got nothing, man.

00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:30.652
Can you spare a quarter or a nickel?

00:02:30.652 --> 00:02:32.028
I said I ain't got nothing.

00:02:42.455 --> 00:02:43.665
Excuse me, sir.

00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:46.001

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:41.814
Thank you.

00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:02.043
What?

00:09:04.754 --> 00:09:06.464
You've never seen a blind and deaf guy before?

00:09:21.396 --> 00:09:23.106
Wait, man...come on!

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.944
Why I gotta get stuck with this?

00:09:29.195 --> 00:09:30.655
[gentle music]

00:10:14.115 --> 00:10:15.617

00:14:32.915 --> 00:14:33.666
Wait!

00:14:38.337 --> 00:14:39.881
You mind waiting just a quick second?

00:14:48.222 --> 00:14:49.599
This guy's blind and deaf.

00:14:49.724 --> 00:14:50.474
You gotta tap him

00:14:50.474 --> 00:14:52.518
and let him know when he gets to 129th street.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:53.936
His name's Artie.

00:14:56.647 --> 00:14:57.857
Excuse me, sir.

00:14:58.900 --> 00:14:59.442
Could you tap him

00:14:59.442 --> 00:15:01.319
and let him know when he gets to 129th street?

00:15:01.319 --> 00:15:01.944
Sure.

00:15:01.944 --> 00:15:03.362
No, not "sure."

00:15:06.324 --> 00:15:07.700
He just wants to get home.

00:15:08.034 --> 00:15:09.285
I'm gonna take care of the man.

00:15:09.285 --> 00:15:10.912
Artie.

00:15:13.414 --> 00:15:15.583
I'm gonna take care of Artie.

00:15:15.833 --> 00:15:18.878
Get him off the bus at 129th street.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.839
Thank you.
