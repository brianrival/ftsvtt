[clapboard sound]

00:00:06.291 --> 00:00:07.250
Ok, great.

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:10.875
[clapboard sound]

00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:14.000
Interpreter: “Okay so, right in front of me, right?”

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.875
Interpreter: She says,
“yes, 12 o’ clock.”

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:18.375
Carl: Do you want to give me a countdown?

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:20.000
Man: Yes. And, marker.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.250
[clapboard sound]

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.375
Fatou: Well, to be real with you,
throughout my life,

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:26.125
I've seen that many people
don't have an understanding

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:28.125
of DeafBlind culture
and the DeafBlind community.

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:31.875
They think that all DeafBlind people
are entirely without vision and hearing,

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:35.125
when in reality there are
different ways to be DeafBlind.

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:38.250
There are many things that people have yet
to learn about DeafBlindness.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.875
Ask and you'll know more.

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:41.750
[music ends]

00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:45.833
David: Yeah, I think one of the largest

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:50.333
misconceptions about people with blindness
is that, “What do you mean? You're not blind!

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:53.458
You can see, you can see me right now.”
And it's like ‘Well, okay, yeah,

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:57.083
but I'm legally blind...” So,
you know, there's a big spectrum there.

00:00:57.083 --> 00:00:59.208
And actually people come upon blindness

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:02.833
in various ways,
some very early on in life like me.

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:06.083
Others get it later in life,
and they've gone

00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:08.958
large amounts of their life
with good usable vision.

00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:14.333
Some person may have a very similar vision
on the doctors’ acuity chart

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:17.208
but may have different experiences.

00:01:17.208 --> 00:01:20.833
Anne: I was accused of faking it a few times
and then I try to explain

00:01:21.083 --> 00:01:25.583
the definition of blindness
and that if you put 20 blind people

00:01:25.583 --> 00:01:28.458
in a room, they all see differently,

00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:31.208
but chances are most of them
see a little bit.

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:32.708
Rocky: I think oftentimes

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:36.708
someone in the general public,
when they view someone who is DeafBlind

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:40.208
they oftentimes think of Helen Keller.

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:45.333
And indeed, Helen Keller was
a great example of someone

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:51.583
who is DeafBlind, and she provided
a lot of inspiration for a lot of people.

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:54.333
But she doesn't represent
the full community.

00:01:55.208 --> 00:01:59.333
Sarah: A lot of people misunderstand, that
oh, when they see a DeafBlind person,

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:04.375
“oh, all DeafBlind Individuals
have the same needs.”

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.000
So all DeafBlind individuals read Braille,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.458
or all DeafBlind
individuals are just like Helen Keller.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:16.083
I am not Helen Keller.

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:19.083
I don't look anything like Helen Keller.

00:02:19.083 --> 00:02:21.333
My life is nothing like hers.

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:24.958
Rocky: But she doesn't represent
the entirety of DeafBlindness.

00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:27.458
DeafBlindness really is a spectrum.

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:30.583
[music plays]

00:02:33.458 --> 00:02:38.958
Lydia: Septo-optic dysplasia means
that the optic nerve did not develop.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.083
So my eyes are,

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:44.458
quote “normal,” as you could say.

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:46.208
It's just that

00:02:46.208 --> 00:02:50.333
since the optic nerve is not developed,
I'm not able to use them to see.

00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:55.375
Meredith: Charge syndrome is a series
of six different anomalies.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.583
Some of us are fully deaf,
some of us can hear only a little.

00:02:57.583 --> 00:02:59.458
I can only hear a little bit.

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:01.833
Rocky: I was diagnosed at infancy

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:05.458
with a condition known as Norrie’s disease.

00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:07.958
It's a genetic condition

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:12.083
which almost always leads to blindness.

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:15.208
So I've been blind all of my life.

00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:17.458
No vision, no light perception.

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:22.333
And then when I was about ten years old,
I began to develop a hearing impairment.

00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:24.958
David: I really believe that

00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:26.958
disability is a spectrum.

00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:31.208
We're all in various states
of ability, whether it be

00:03:31.208 --> 00:03:34.833
a visual disability, a hearing disability,
a cognitive disability

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:36.208
a mobility disability.

00:03:36.208 --> 00:03:40.833
There's people who may not present and
have a quote unquote “hidden disability”

00:03:41.208 --> 00:03:44.625
all the way to people
who have very profound disabilities

00:03:44.625 --> 00:03:47.583
that are evident for everybody

00:03:47.583 --> 00:03:49.208
to witness and take part of.

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:53.083
So whatever the case may be,
within each of those prevalence

00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:58.083
types, there's spectrums and two people
with quote unquote "matching disabilities”

00:03:58.083 --> 00:04:00.333
may present or behave very differently.

00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:03.208
Why? Because we're all different to begin with.

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:05.833
So people with disabilities
are no different in that way.

00:04:06.208 --> 00:04:09.458
Rebecca: You could have somebody
who is, again, culturally Deaf,

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:12.458
they're born deaf, they're raised
in like the deaf community,

00:04:12.708 --> 00:04:17.333
maybe their family is deaf or, you know,
they go to school and it's a deaf school

00:04:17.833 --> 00:04:20.333
and then they're progressively
losing their vision.

00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:25.708
So they go from using sign language
to needing to learn tactile sign language.

00:04:25.958 --> 00:04:30.583
Sarah: Within the DeafBlind community
some may rely on the

00:04:30.583 --> 00:04:32.708
residual hearing that they have.

00:04:32.708 --> 00:04:36.125
If you’re fully DeafBlind
then you would rely on tactile

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:39.333
and that is simply hand on hand
American Sign Language,

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:43.583
so I would sign using airspace
like American Sign Language, does

00:04:43.708 --> 00:04:47.333
But it would be through a tactile sense
as her hand is on top of mine.

00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:51.833
Rebecca: You have people who are born
into a hearing-sighted family

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:57.333
and they're raised getting cochlear
implanted at a very young age.

00:04:57.458 --> 00:05:01.333
And they're given, you know,
whether it's a one-on-one educator

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:05.708
or it's an assistant
there's all different

00:05:05.708 --> 00:05:09.458
types of educational assistance
you can get for a kid like that.

00:05:09.458 --> 00:05:10.208
But you may have

00:05:10.208 --> 00:05:14.458
somebody who has DeafBlindness,
but pretty much in their school-age years,

00:05:14.708 --> 00:05:18.458
they're able to function
pretty well as like a mainstream kid.

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:21.708
Sarah: I really struggled in the beginning
with my Deaf identity.

00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:24.083
I tried to navigate, you know,

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:28.458
because I felt like I was never hearing
enough, yet I was never deaf enough.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.583
And so I kind of fluctuated
and kind of was stuck in the middle.

00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:35.333
And I just really
did not know where I belong.

00:05:36.208 --> 00:05:38.083
Fatou: When you're born
with Usher syndrome

00:05:38.083 --> 00:05:40.833
your field of vision
gradually gets smaller and smaller.

00:05:41.208 --> 00:05:45.708
Some people experience tunnel vision,
some have blurry vision, or have specks

00:05:45.708 --> 00:05:49.458
or spots that impede their vision,
or reduced peripheral vision.

00:05:49.458 --> 00:05:50.583
Anne: My brother and I, we both...

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:52.708
My brother has Usher Syndrome too,

00:05:52.708 --> 00:05:56.208
my brother and I have
the same disease, the same gene.

00:05:56.458 --> 00:05:57.958
We have different vision.

00:05:57.958 --> 00:05:59.708
Carl: Annie’s vision is quite a bit
better than mine.

00:05:59.708 --> 00:06:01.833
She’s almost six years younger than me.

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:02.583
Who knows why?

00:06:02.583 --> 00:06:05.083
Maybe because she eats a better diet
or whatever.

00:06:05.458 --> 00:06:08.958
Rebecca: When you say you're DeafBlind
you could be anywhere on this very large spectrum.

00:06:08.958 --> 00:06:13.458
And the interesting thing
is, somebody who is DeafBlind

00:06:13.458 --> 00:06:17.083
and is really raised in a mainstream world
and someone who is DeafBlind,

00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:20.458
who is raised in the deaf world,
they are about as different

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:24.333
as anyone from any different community.

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:27.958
And being DeafBlind
does not even mean that you identify

00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:31.500
with the entire DeafBlind world
or community itself.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.250
[music plays]

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.375
David: Consider that the human condition
comes in every shape

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:41.750
and size and every ethnicity
and race and every

00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:46.125
social strata; that is
people with disabilities.

00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:47.875
People with disabilities are everybody.

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:51.875
They're our friends, they're our family,
our sons or daughters, our neighbors.

00:06:51.875 --> 00:06:55.125
Really everybody.
Disability is the story of us.
