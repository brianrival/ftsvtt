00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.625
Lydia: A very critical piece of advocating
is being able toto

00:00:06.625 --> 00:00:10.000
be a good thinker, a good problem solver,
and to be able to come up

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.125
with alternative solutions
instead of just saying,

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:13.875
with alternative solutions
instead of just saying,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.625
“oh, no, I can't do that then
because this accommodation

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:20.166
or service isn't available.”

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:23.375
[music plays]

00:00:28.541 --> 00:00:30.541
Alice: A: know your facts.

00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.291
Pull up your history, pull up
whatever details you can,

00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:37.208
but you need to be able to show that

00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:40.916
timeline of why something isn't working.

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:45.291
And sometimes it's actually being
able to literally identify

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.166
who the broken link is in a chain,

00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:51.916
and knowing the details, knowing
where to go, if you can't afford it

00:00:51.916 --> 00:00:53.041
or they can't afford it,

00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:57.791
there are ways for things to be done
that are cost effective.

00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:01.916
There are entities
that give that kind of advice, naturally.

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:07.416
You just need to know how to channel them
to it. But you've got to be able to do it

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:10.416
without necessarily
being outrageously hostile.

00:01:10.416 --> 00:01:12.666
Although I have done that too.

00:01:13.041 --> 00:01:13.791
[laughing]

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:17.541
Because sometimes
it's just a word game for them.

00:01:17.916 --> 00:01:20.166
But your words are my life.

00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:25.166
You know, when you downplay

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:30.166
my access in an emergency room,
that could be the difference

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:33.166
between a life outcome

00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:35.666
for me going there or not.

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:38.416
If I'm going to a doctor
and they’re

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:42.666
totally disavowing the fact that I know
my body and I know what I feel,

00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:47.791
they're missing a diagnosis
that might be evident to somebody else.

00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:49.166
I know that because I've done that

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:51.916
and switched doctors
and found out that I was right.

00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:55.416
So you have to be able
to have your facts ready,

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:58.041
have your arguments ready,

00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:01.416
and if you can't argue your case, well,

00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:04.166
grab a few people that you know
that can argue well for you.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:07.666
Lydia: I have had many,
many instances in my life

00:02:07.666 --> 00:02:11.791
where one thing didn't work
and I had to be willing

00:02:11.791 --> 00:02:15.291
and able to come up
with a backup solution.

00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:19.916
And I would also say that you can't depend
on the other person to do that

00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:24.666
because more times than not
someone that you may be advocating to

00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:27.791
is not going to be familiar
with DeafBlindness.

00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:30.541
And so you should be aware of

00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:32.541
options that you have and be

00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:36.541
prepared to come to the table
with alternative solutions.

00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:42.666
So I would just say that that is
a really important thing to consider

00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:47.916
as you're advocating and telling people
what you need from them.

00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:51.291
Rocky: I think oftentimes, you know,
we will teach

00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:54.416
people who want to become advocates,

00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:57.041
when we're training them, we'll say,
you know, “don't be

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:01.291
confrontational,
be assertive, don't be confrontational.”

00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:03.041
You can be assertive.

00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:07.166
And I wholeheartedly agree that you should
be assertive over being confrontational.

00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:13.666
However, the best advocates
are not afraid of conflict.

00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:16.041
Sometimes conflict is just necessary.

00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:20.166
Back in the 1980s, for example,
we had a couple of people who are blind

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:25.791
who were arrested because
they refused to leave their seats

00:03:26.041 --> 00:03:28.666
in the emergency exit row

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:31.791
of airplanes because, you know,

00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:34.666
sighted people were allowed to sit
in those areas, but they weren't.

00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:39.916
Rosanna: Advocacy really is
summed up in persistence.

00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:43.416
You have to be persistent, be out there.

00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:49.541
Your actions will speak louder
than words in many, many cases.

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:53.291
The most important thing
that you can do for yourself

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:57.291
is to develop

00:03:57.916 --> 00:03:59.416
your own persona

00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:04.416
and develop your skills,
know what your skills are,

00:04:05.041 --> 00:04:09.166
and promote those skills
to the best of your ability

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.791
so that you can be successful

00:04:12.416 --> 00:04:15.416
in the society that we live in today.

00:04:15.916 --> 00:04:19.041
Just because you may be DeafBlind,

00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:22.916
does not mean
that you can't be successful.

00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:26.791
The road to success
is out there for you.

00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:29.791
If you look for it and you work at it

00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:32.916
and you pursue your dreams.

00:04:33.416 --> 00:04:35.166
Rocky: You're going to have to
know what your needs are.

00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:39.541
You're going to have to know
what your needs are not, because sometimes

00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:43.666
we are offered accommodations
that aren’t necessarily necessary

00:04:45.416 --> 00:04:47.166
and that

00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:50.791
can also be very demeaning as well.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:54.916
You know, if you have a backbone,
if you have thick skin,

00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:59.416
if you don't allow yourself to be trampled
over, people will have respect for you.

00:04:59.416 --> 00:05:02.541
And that's true
if you are DeafBlind or not.

00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:05.916
People tend to respect you more

00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:09.166
if you're able to speak up
more for yourself.

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:11.791
And as Rosanna said, if you're persistent,

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:15.416
it can earn you a lot of respect
and a lot of trust.

00:05:16.041 --> 00:05:19.041
Alice: You have to have the language
to be able to do it.

00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:23.666
You have to have a sense of class
and to know when you need to step back

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.166
and find another way or another person

00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:29.416
to go through to get the same job done.

00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:32.916
But giving up, don't do it.

00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:35.541
There's got to be a way.

00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:37.041
[laughing]

00:05:37.041 --> 00:05:38.666
[music plays]

00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:45.916
Rocky: I’m more appreciative than I can say that
we're having this roundtable discussion

00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:49.041
and this isn't just for us
as people who are DeafBlind.

00:05:49.041 --> 00:05:51.541
This is also for the general public.

00:05:51.541 --> 00:05:53.291
We've got to get our voices out there.

00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:58.166
Rosanna: Allowing us and giving us the opportunity
to be here and share this roundtable

00:05:58.166 --> 00:05:59.041
with all of you,

00:05:59.041 --> 00:06:02.541
it has been just a
wonderful, wonderful experience.

00:06:02.791 --> 00:06:03.791
Thank you so much.

00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:07.791
Lydia: I cannot put into words
how much this means to me

00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:13.666
that we are going to be able to be heard.

00:06:13.916 --> 00:06:18.291
Alice: This is really the real reality,
not the in-between

00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:21.791
and the cute little pictures that
you draw that you think is us.

00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:23.416
This is us.

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:25.666
And only we can tell you.

00:06:25.666 --> 00:06:28.166
It’s just gravy to being able to

00:06:29.666 --> 00:06:32.041
put a little exclamation point on

00:06:32.041 --> 00:06:35.416
this is our life and we
should have the right to direct it

00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:39.416
to some degree that's going to be
meaningful and make us feel proud.

00:06:41.166 --> 00:06:45.333
