00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:03.708
I thought I was disabled.

2
00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:06.291
And I didn't know what was going on.

3
00:00:06.291 --> 00:00:10.583
But when they gave me this
visual language, this way to communicate,

4
00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:12.916
it was like a fire was lit inside of me.

5
00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:18.833
I wanted to be like everybody else.

6
00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:21.458
I wanted to do what everybody else did.

7
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:27.000
They pretty much wanted to decide for me
what I could and could not do.

8
00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:28.083
That's up to me.

9
00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:33.291
It's challenging, honestly, for DeafBlind
people to begin their journey

10
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.791
in employment, to just get onto
the first rung of the ladder.

11
00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:40.458
There are people out there
that won't give us a chance.

12
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.500
Shame on them.

13
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.625
You know, shame on them.

14
00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:51.416
People who are DeafBlind
and have accomplished many, many things.

15
00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:55.833
We have the same goals and interests,
the same attitudes, the same aptitudes.

16
00:00:56.125 --> 00:01:00.000
Everybody learns in their own way,
and we have to accept that.

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.375
And that's simply life.

18
00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:04.583
And that goes the same for the work world.

19
00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:07.541
You have to find out what
you can do and do your best.

20
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.250
Hi, my name is Bienvenido Batista.

21
00:01:13.708 --> 00:01:15.916
My name is James Byrne.

22
00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:17.000
My name is Linda Jones.

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.250
Rosanna Beaudrie.

24
00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:19.583
My name is Korrine Hearlth.

25
00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:21.583
This is Chris Woodfill speaking.

26
00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:22.916
My name is Rocky Hart.

27
00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.791
My name is Isatou Sankanu.

28
00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:27.666
It was pretty awkward in the beginning.

29
00:01:27.708 --> 00:01:29.583
I learned a lot from other people.

30
00:01:29.583 --> 00:01:33.375
I'm just a normal person
doing a normal job.

31
00:01:33.583 --> 00:01:38.333
I don't usually brag,
but I'm really good at what I do.

32
00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:43.208
Having a disability does not mean
that you can't be successful.

33
00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:45.625
It's just the opposite.

34
00:01:45.625 --> 00:01:48.708
I got recognition for the work
that I was doing.

35
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:50.041
Iâ€™m so proud of it.

36
00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:50.916
I really like it.

37
00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:52.958
My self-confidence, my self-esteem

38
00:01:52.958 --> 00:01:55.375
has just gone through
the roof because I can.
