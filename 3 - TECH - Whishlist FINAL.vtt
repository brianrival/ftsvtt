00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.041
As a DeafBlind person,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.166
Bryan: I donâ€™t have anything in particular on
my wish list, but what I'd like to see

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:10.041
is more technology
that is simple to use in the future.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.666
Because today there are so many different
ways to zoom on the screen

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:18.333
or use braille displays. We often
have to use two or more devices.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:22.250
It's cumbersome. It's too much on us.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.250
Oh, and cost. A lot of assistive
technology is expensive,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.500
I'd like to see that reduced.

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.791
[music plays]

00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:39.916
Chris: I agree. I'm on the
same page as you, Bryan.

00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:42.625
And I'd like to see more smart technology.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:43.875
To be able to turn on the lights

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:46.250
from pressing a few
buttons on my iPhone

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.125
or be able to adjust the thermostat
or turn on the hot water and so on.

00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:52.291
With just a few clicks on my iPhone,

00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:56.916
the ability to do all of that
from one device, that would be cool.

00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:00.666
For me, it's important
because as my fields of vision reduces,

00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:04.875
it becomes even more important to be able
to control everything from my iPhone.

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:06.625
Bapin: In the future,

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:11.166
I would like to be able to drive a car
using an autonomous vehicle.

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:14.875
That technology is not a 100% safe yet,

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:18.375
but I know that there are some blind
people involved in the testing,

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:21.125
but they haven't yet
included the ability to connect

00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:25.791
braille displays in the car
through Bluetooth or USB.

00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:29.333
If they do that,
I'd be able to set an address

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.125
or a destination
and the car could just take me there.

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.666
Second on
my wish list is a robotic human being.

00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:38.458
I would like to join meetings through Zoom

00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:40.375
or to make video phone calls,

00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:42.958
but I can't see
the interpreter on the screen

00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:47.500
which means I always have to hire
an interpreter using tactile sign language

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.541
to understand what is being said.

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.000
More and more deaf people

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.250
have gotten rid of their TTY,
so I can't communicate

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.208
directly with my deaf friends
anymore in real time.

00:01:57.208 --> 00:01:58.875
I can really only text them.

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:01.500
I would love to have a robotic human

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.041
that could copy the signs of the person
on the screen tactilely to me

00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:10.875
so that the deaf person on the screen
could communicate directly with me.

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:14.291
Scott: The other thing we have to remember
is that there are still barriers.

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:18.000
And I wanted to give
a couple of brief examples

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.375
of why that is, and also
some examples of why

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:27.041
things can still cause issues
for people with various disabilities.

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:29.375
As a DeafBlind person,

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:32.375
you're in a very tough spot in some ways,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.625
although it's getting better.
And the reason for that

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:38.875
is that a lot of technology
that is developed for the blind

00:02:39.916 --> 00:02:42.916
utilizes audio to convey

00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:46.625
whatever information that
the blind person can access.

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:49.166
You know, for example,
a talking book player or,

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.500
you know, maybe they have

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.666
what's called an audio described movie

00:02:54.666 --> 00:02:59.416
where a narrator will explain
to you the action that's on the screen.

00:02:59.416 --> 00:03:02.666
A deaf person might have
a strobe light to wake them up.

00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:04.875
They might

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:08.125
have any number
of other visual modifications

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:12.500
that help them work with things
that they're not able to access.

00:03:12.916 --> 00:03:15.416
And don't get me wrong,
I'm not criticizing those.

00:03:15.416 --> 00:03:17.541
I'm glad that those people have access

00:03:17.541 --> 00:03:20.541
to those things
and that they're able to do it.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.166
But the problem is,
if you haven't put it together yet,

00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:27.250
that if you're deaf and blind,

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:30.875
well, you can't see the strobe light,

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:35.708
you can't hear the audio description.
So what do you do?

00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:40.250
And this is a shortcoming that technology
developers are getting way more aware of.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.000
I'll say that for it,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.458
but it's a problem that has
manifested itself in different ways.

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:50.500
We talked about accessing
even the web, the internet.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.625
Not every page is created

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:58.125
equally on that, on
the internet. Some websites

00:03:58.375 --> 00:04:03.000
who have listings for jobs,
when you go to apply for them

00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:07.625
that process is not fully accessible.
Here in the United States

00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:10.916
and many other countries,
a lot of your identity

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:13.916
is based on what you do.

00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:17.291
Well, what I do

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:25.625
may not be much in terms of a vocation
if I'm not able to even apply for that job.

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:27.375
So in my view,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.666
hopefully we will have
self-driving cars one day.

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:35.291
Hopefully we'll have one universal device
that is accessible to everyone

00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:39.291
and all you need to do is enable whatever
feature you need and you're good to go.

00:04:39.625 --> 00:04:44.875
I foresee a day when that will happen,
and I have a lot of hope for the future.

00:04:44.875 --> 00:04:47.666
We've come a long way.
We really have, but

00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:49.750
we still have a long ways to go.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.416
[music plays]

00:04:56.583 --> 00:04:59.625
Scott: Disability can affect anybody.

00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:05.875
It can be a part-time or temporary thing
or it can be a lifelong thing.

00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:09.958
Whether maybe it's you
who has a disability,

00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:13.083
perhaps you were in an accident
and now you have one.

00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:17.500
I mean, if your son or daughter
all of a sudden became DeafBlind,

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.875
you'd probably want to know
what to do, right?

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:23.208
Or have a general idea
of what's out there.

00:05:23.875 --> 00:05:27.500
Second reason,
like I said, is with inclusivity,

00:05:27.916 --> 00:05:32.291
maybe you don't need the assistive
technology, but what if you work

00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:36.291
with someone who does?
Wouldn't you want to communicate with them?

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:38.458
Chris: Great comment, Scott.

00:05:38.458 --> 00:05:40.250
In addition, I have noticed

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.208
that assistive technology benefits
those that don't have a disability.

00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:46.291
I have a good example of that.

00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:49.500
So there's an employee
who work here at Helen Keller

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.625
who does not have a disability.

00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:54.833
However, this individual has said
that they are tired

00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:58.708
of reading the computer screen all day
and that it can be very taxing

00:05:58.708 --> 00:06:02.458
on their eyes. I suggested
using ZoomText Fusion.

00:06:02.958 --> 00:06:04.750
They said they didn't
need something like that

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.500
because they're not blind
and they don't have low vision.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.291
But I suggested that they try it.

00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:13.833
The first thing that employee did was
invert the colors on the computer screen

00:06:13.833 --> 00:06:17.166
and almost immediately
notice that their eyes were less tired.

00:06:17.166 --> 00:06:23.166
They hadn't realized staring at a white
bright screen all day was so problematic.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:24.583
Simply by inverting the colors,

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:27.875
they were able to look at the computer
screen all day without issue.

00:06:28.625 --> 00:06:30.708
I think that's a good example
of how a person

00:06:30.708 --> 00:06:35.166
without a disability assumes they cannot
benefit from assistive technology

00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:36.708
but because they may experience

00:06:36.708 --> 00:06:40.958
tiredness or eye strain,
assistive technology can benefit them.

00:06:40.958 --> 00:06:44.041
And at that point it may click
that assistive technology

00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:46.916
is not only for people with disabilities,

00:06:46.916 --> 00:06:50.041
it can open up their minds
to how it can apply to them.

00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:54.000
Bapin: There used to be this separate
decoder caption device

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.958
for deaf people for closed captioning.

00:06:56.958 --> 00:07:00.291
Today that technology, closed captions,

00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:02.875
is built right into the television.

00:07:02.875 --> 00:07:06.833
Hearing people benefit from that,
not just deaf people.

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:09.750
If the sound isn't on,
they can read the captions too.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.125
Originally, the Wintel device

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:15.125
was made for deaf people
to be able to text,

00:07:15.125 --> 00:07:18.291
but later it became popular with everyone.

00:07:18.291 --> 00:07:20.375
Hearing people used it.

00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:24.750
Again, benefitting from what was designed
with deaf people in mind.

00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:27.583
Scot: Have you ever used a curb cut?

00:07:27.583 --> 00:07:32.500
Maybe you have a child, an infant,
who is in a stroller.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.750
Have you ever been in a bar

00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:38.500
and had to use, maybe you

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.166
wanted to know what was going on
on the news or something and it was loud

00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:44.500
and you use closed captioning?

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:48.208
Audiobooks.You ever wanted
to listen to a book instead of read it?

00:07:48.208 --> 00:07:51.750
Maybe you're driving, maybe you're doing
whatever it is you're doing.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:56.000
Those three examples
I just gave all came about

00:07:56.625 --> 00:08:02.041
because people with disabilities
needed a different way to access material.

00:08:02.041 --> 00:08:04.125
So adaptive technology

00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:09.416
in some way, shape, or form can help
people who don't even have disabilities.

00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:12.750
Chris: Thank you for sharing those examples.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.833
They're important points, for sure.

00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:17.291
Thank you, everyone, for being here.

00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:19.500
