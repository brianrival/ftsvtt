00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:07.875
Francis: Hello. Welcome to you all
for coming together

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:11.791
to recognize Frank and Kathy.

00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:16.000
Grace: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.041
Not your preaching.

00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:20.166
No, You say sentence.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:24.291
“I preached this wedding

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:27.875
for deaf and blind couple.”

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:33.250
The sentence, not you preaching

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:42.041
Francis: I preached more of a blessing

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:45.166
to a deaf and blind couple
for their wedding.

00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:50.000
They were both deaf and blind,
and I had a blessing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.583
on their relationship.

00:00:52.583 --> 00:00:55.916
[music plays]

00:01:00.416 --> 00:01:03.500
Grace: Your patience level with
your parents is much lower.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.625
The bar is low, so as a kid you're like,
“your voice is weird.”

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:07.875
Like “stop.”

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:08.791
Like, “don't be loud.”

00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:10.250
Like, we would go out

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.625
and he would try to talk, either
my dad or my mom would talk to us

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:17.041
and they use their voice
and it's like the room is quiet, please.

00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:18.125
Like, be quiet.

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:22.166
Francis: I'm not realizing that
my voice is being used.

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.250
I can't hear my voice.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.541
I don't know what it sounds like.

00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:26.875
It's very bass It's very low.

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:28.125
It's loud.

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:29.500
And so for them, they're embarrassed.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.125
So I do try to like, you know, manage and,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.166
you know, figure out how I can help them
as they help me.

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:40.625
Grace: Growing up interpreting for my dad,
since he is deaf and blind,

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:44.375
I would say it's been a little bit
difficult.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.375
Difficult, more like physically,
I think for both of us,

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.791
because you have to
sign with someone that is,

00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:55.416
you know, has their hand on top of you
that it can get tiring for both of us

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.125
and that it's taxing on
both of our arms to sign.

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:02.541
And sometimes if it's a long meeting
that I'm interpreting for

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:08.708
or if it's a movie that I'm interpreting,
it's really hard to like not be tired.

00:02:08.708 --> 00:02:13.666
As someone whose parents are deaf and deaf
and blind is you help them so much,

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:17.541
you kind of, you don't
get to do your own thing sometimes

00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:20.875
you're like, “hey, you're going
to the doctor's appointment with me.”

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:21.750
You're like, “great.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.958
I wanted to go do something else.”

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:28.000
Francis: Really, in general, in
just everyday things

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I would rather have
someone else interpret.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.291
I don't want to depend on my children.

00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:35.791
They have their own life,
their own things that they're doing.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.666
But if they're around, they're nearby,

00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:40.250
we're at a family gathering,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.875
then of course, you know,

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:45.500
I'll have them to interpret
if they feel comfortable for me.

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:51.291
Yes, there are ups and downs,
just as any family, any parent to children.

00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:55.000
[music plays]

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:00.125
Grace: You have these emotions
attached to your parents.

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:02.250
So if they're saying something, you're like,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.041
“ah, I don't want you to say
something like that.”

00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:06.416
And so you have this like
internal like, don't say that.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.625
Whereas when you're interpreting
for a stranger, it's just this

00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:10.625
like they're allowed

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:13.375
to say what they want to say
because you don't know any backstory.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:17.000
So I think kind of
that could be the negative to it,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
but then it could also be a positive
because sometimes as a child interpreting

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.458
for my dad, I can see other interpreters
and be like, you're not doing him justice.

00:03:25.458 --> 00:03:29.500
If they're missing something that he said,
if it's important, I'm going to say,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.500
“Hey, don't forget he said this.”

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.125
If they add something in, I'm like,
“ah,” like it doesn't feel so great.

00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:41.375
I feel like what he's trying to
express is not getting across.

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:43.625
So as a daughter, I'm like, you're not,

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.125
you know, expressing
exactly what he's saying to you.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.875
Francis: There's a lot of misunderstanding
and miscommunication that can happen.

00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:55.000
So there's a place where you want
to make sure that you're

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.875
understanding each other
because there's so many different styles.

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:02.750
A lot of interpreters
have to make sure that it's clear.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.291
And the same thing with my kids.

00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:06.666
[music plays]

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:13.125
Grace: Because my dad can't see
and he can't hear.

00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:16.000
his senses are pretty strong.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.125
So one story that he and I
were talking about yesterday

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:24.250
was because I knew he was deaf and blind,
I would take advantage of that.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.625
So I loved watching TV
and I would sneak and watch TV.

00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:33.625
And as soon as I heard my dad coming,
I would turn it off and I would go hide.

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:37.750
And he would come over and he's brilliant.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.750
He would put his hand on the TV and feel
if it was hot or warm, and he'd go,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.208
“Grace was here” and he would yell
and he would get so mad at me.

00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:48.250
And I'm like, he's too smart.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.375
Or if I'm trying to sneak something
food wise, I'll like, start eating it.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.000
And he's like, “What are you eating?”

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.250
And I'm like, ah, chocolate something. Ah.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.250
So I definitely think he's got
superpowers for sure.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.375
Francis: When I became fully blind, my nose

00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:06.666
and that touch, they got more sensitive.

00:05:06.916 --> 00:05:10.500
If they're eating Japanese food
and I'm eating Italian food and I'm like,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.791
Oh, we're all eating the same thing.

00:05:11.791 --> 00:05:14.500
I'm like, “wait, why do I smell fish?

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.625
Are you guys eating something
different than I'm eating?”

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:19.500
So yeah, I can definitely use
those senses.

00:05:19.916 --> 00:05:22.041
Grace: Looking back, when I was a kid,

00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:25.500
I definitely one, I took advantage.

00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:30.250
And secondly, I really didn't understand

00:05:30.875 --> 00:05:34.166
fully what his situation was

00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:36.500
and how frustrating life really is.

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:41.500
And I think now as an adult
and I see like all the different things

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.416
that I could have done differently
to make your life easier,

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:50.250
I look back and I wish that I did it,
but now moving forward,

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.875
I can do it and I'm going
to continue to learn.

00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:58.000
But you are a wonderful man
and very inspirational.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:02.750
And there's many, many, many, many people
that look to you as an inspiration.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:03.666
So thank you.

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:06.291
Francis: I'm laughing.

00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:08.500
But you know what?

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.416
In some way, I understand
that she's understanding more and now

00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:16.791
I'm going to keep an eye on her like a hawk
and I'm going to make sure she does it.

00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:21.250
But I love her always.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.041
