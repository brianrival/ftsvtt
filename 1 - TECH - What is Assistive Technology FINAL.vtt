00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.166
Scott: Really technology

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:09.250
has opened up so many doors
over the last couple of decades

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.791
and has absolutely led
to more inclusiveness

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:17.750
for people who are
blind and hard of hearing

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.750
or who have a dual sensory loss.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.250
(music plays)

00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:32.958
Chris: We have four DeafBlind participants here
today, sitting in a circle.

00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:38.208
Additionally, we have a tactile
sign language interpreter interpreting to Bapin.

00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:41.291
We have visual ASL interpreters
sitting to the right

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.583
of Scott Davert.

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:46.166
Visual interpreters will sign
so that the tactile interpreter

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:52.541
can copy sign to Bapin. And Bryan
and I will access the interpreter visually

00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:56.250
Not visible on camera is the ASL
to English interpreter

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.416
who will voice into spoken English,
what Bryan, Bapin, and I are signing.

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:04.666
The voice interpreter
is utilizing a neck loop mic

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.208
with Bluetooth capability

00:01:06.208 --> 00:01:08.875
that will transmit the sound directly to Scott.

00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:12.750
All four participants have access,
meaning as DeafBlind individuals,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.458
we can participate
in the roundtable discussion.

00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:19.666
[music plays]

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:25.625
Chris: Scott, would you like to start us off
by answering that question?

00:01:25.875 --> 00:01:30.250
Scott: I don't actually know that there's
a single answer to that because there's a lot of overlap.

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:35.166
There are, adaptive, of course,
means that you're adapting things to

00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:39.791
work for an individual
that's not using the only,

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:42.750
only the main features
built into something-

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.500
But it's also assistive in the sense
that it assists people

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.291
who are not necessarily able
to access features in certain devices

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.750
unless certain things are turned on.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:59.250
So, for example, my iPhone,

00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:02.791
I wouldn't call that necessarily
assistive technology,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.041
but it has assistive technology
built into it.

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:08.875
Bapin: They are synonymous.

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:11.125
In fact, both mean technology

00:02:11.125 --> 00:02:13.875
that gives us better access
to information

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:16.916
for anyone with any type of disability,

00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:20.625
be that blind, deaf, or DeafBlind.

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:24.208
Bryan: My perspective on the words
is that they're similar,

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:28.083
but the word assistive seems to encompass
all people with disabilities,

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:32.250
whereas adaptive is specifically
to support people with low vision

00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:35.625
or with vision loss
and those types of accommodations.

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:36.958
That's my perspective.

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:40.250
Chris: I appreciate your perspectives
on the use of the terms.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.041
We may use these terms interchangeably
throughout this discussion today.

00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:49.083
[music plays]

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:55.500
Bryan: Assistive technology
is a kind of tool or system

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.500
to give us access in our everyday lives

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.041
and our workplace to level the playing
field with our able-bodied peers.

00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:05.333
It gives us more access.

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:08.958
It's really important,
most of us feel we need something,

00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:11.333
but each of us might
need something different.

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:13.833
Assistive technology helps us function.

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:16.500
Bapin: This is technology that has benefits

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.875
for hearing-sighted people as well.
For example,

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:21.416
I use my laptop.

00:03:21.416 --> 00:03:25.291
I can't access it
because I can't see or hear.

00:03:25.791 --> 00:03:28.000
I need to use a braille display

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.625
and that looks like what I have with me
now, as you can see.

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:35.250
This one is smaller
as I use it with my iPhone,

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.708
but I have a larger braille display
that I use with my laptop.

00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:43.208
I connect the devices,
but there is also a screen reader

00:03:43.208 --> 00:03:44.750
which is the software that

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.916
essentially will relay the information

00:03:46.916 --> 00:03:48.291
on the screen

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.458
to my braille display so I can read it.

00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:56.500
So that is what I call necessary
adaptive technology.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.875
Scott: Once I started losing more
of my hearing, I had to transition

00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:04.125
to being a braille user,
which was kind of a struggle.

00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:07.166
But I made it work and

00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:12.166
like Bapin I have my braille
display paired to my iPhone

00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:15.916
and also use a braille display
on my computer.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.375
In addition to that, though,
I also use a lot of technology,

00:04:20.375 --> 00:04:24.375
which helps me hear better.
If I go into a restaurant, for example,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.625
and it's very loud, as they often are,
even these days,

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:32.125
it's very difficult for me to understand
what people are saying

00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:35.166
that I'm in conversations with.

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:41.500
So the microphone that is in use right now
also get used in those environments

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.000
so that I can go out and have a conversation
with somebody in a loud environment.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.500
And, you know, it connects me with people.
It makes me feel

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.375
more included in society
than just sitting home doing nothing.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.916
And some of the great things
that come out of it

00:04:58.916 --> 00:05:02.791
are things like something simple
such as text messages.

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:05.791
You know, it really helps
connect you to the world.

00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:09.875
And also, if you want to access the phone
system, for example,

00:05:09.875 --> 00:05:14.291
you could call a restaurant to order food
through a service called text relay.

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:17.500
You can also contact doctors
and things like that.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.125
So really, technology has
opened up so many doors

00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:27.125
over the last couple of decades
and has absolutely led

00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:32.625
to more inclusiveness for people
who are blind and hard of hearing

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:34.750
or who have a dual sensory loss.

00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:40.000
Chris: Take the regular camera on the iPhone,
a feature that is standard on all phones.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.750
I will use that camera

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.875
if I can't see the print,
let's say at a grocery store.

00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:48.500
Often the ingredients are printed
very small on the label.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.041
I can use the camera app
to zoom in on the label and read the words

00:05:53.041 --> 00:05:54.958
much more easily.

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.625
I know that some of you use
assistive technology for your personal use.

00:05:58.625 --> 00:06:01.625
Are there ones you'd like
to mention that are available

00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:03.666
that might benefit other DeafBlind people?

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.666
Bapin: I'm thinking about the word
assistive technology

00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:09.125
and it can be low tech.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.541
We're not always talking
about high tech devices.

00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:14.666
It can mean very low tech things.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:17.125
For example, I work with wood.

00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:18.625
I often have to measure the wood.

00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:22.250
I need something
one foot, three feet, etc.

00:06:22.666 --> 00:06:25.791
I can't access print,
so I use a raille ruler

00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:27.000
or tape measure.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.541
I'd call that assistive technology.

00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:33.541
It's a broad term to describe
anything that gives me access.

00:06:33.541 --> 00:06:34.541
So it's important

00:06:34.541 --> 00:06:36.666
to remember that when we're talking,

00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:40.125
it's not always the high tech stuff
we're talking about.

00:06:40.541 --> 00:06:43.708
