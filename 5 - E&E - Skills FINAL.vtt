00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.250
Rosanna: Your perspective is going to be different.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.500
It has to be.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.666
There are different things
that you need to do in order

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:15.375
to reach the same goal that you're sighted
counterpoint would achieve.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.250
Doesn't mean that you can't.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.666
You certainly can.

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:22.500
But you're going to need to do it
in a different way.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.750
[music plays]

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.791
Rocky: People who are DeafBlind
have accomplished many, many things,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.750
that sometimes gets overlooked.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.250
Many of them work in various types

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.625
of occupations
and in various different ways.

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:49.250
Rosanna: Having a disability does not mean
that you can't be successful.

00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:52.416
It's just the opposite.

00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:54.500
It's okay to be different.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.750
That's what makes me who I am.
That's what makes me, me.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.500
And that's okay.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.375
Rocky: We have the same goals,
the same interests,

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:06.625
the same attitudes, the same aptitudes,
and we want the same opportunities.

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:10.041
Given the opportunity and training,

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:13.750
an individual who is
DeafBlind can accomplish

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:18.750
just as much as someone
who is hearing-sighted.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:23.750
Rosanna: What are the skills that you bring to
the job that you are looking for?

00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:27.416
First of all, I think that's the first thing.

00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:29.750
[music plays]

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.416
Isatou: I came to the
Helen Keller National Center

00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:38.500
for a two-week summer program.

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:40.875
I was paired with a job coach.

00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:44.000
The job coach teaches you
how to find a job,

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:49.000
how to answer interview questions,
how to get around on your job site,

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.500
how to advocate for yourself,

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:53.875
how to explain what your needs are

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:58.000
in terms of accommodations,
really a whole host of things.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.750
We also created communication cards

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.041
so that I could talk with my co-workers.

00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:07.375
James: This particular card allows me
to ask what you would like me to do next.

00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:11.416
So when I'm at work,
I can figure out what my next task is.

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:16.375
This one says, “I'll be coming back to work
at 1:15 this afternoon, thank you.”

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.625
When I work at CVS and I'm busy,

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:22.916
if someone needs assistance,
I wear the receiver on my belt,

00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:25.791
and one of the cashiers
will hold the transmitting button.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.291
So they'll call me, it'll vibrate.

00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:31.666
I'll know to go up to the cashier
and put something away.

00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:35.000
If someone needs something found,
they can just buzz me

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.375
and I'll come up
and follow their direction.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.291
I had a job coach and they trained me.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.291
I would go once a week to work

00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:45.166
and then it was increased
to two times a week.

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:48.291
I was getting close to the six-month mark
where I was going to be finished

00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:50.375
with work, you know, my internship.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.500
But CVS said, ‘you know what?

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.875
You're a great worker.

00:02:54.125 --> 00:02:55.541
We really want to hire you.’

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:57.875
So then I started working six days a week.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.416
I was doing so much work.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.250
Isatou: The goal was to be
more independent.

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:04.750
I was pretty awkward in the beginning.

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:07.208
I was not really independent at the time.

00:03:07.208 --> 00:03:09.666
They would accompany me
throughout the process.

00:03:10.125 --> 00:03:14.166
Eventually we got to the point where I did
everything and I didn't really need

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:17.500
the job coach because I was able
to do everything on my own.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.125
You know, they taught me
what I needed to know.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.166
James: I feel like I'm on par
with my hearing peers, you know.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.541
It's just like we're all workers
and it doesn't matter that I'm deaf.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.875
I really like it.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.875
And, you know, my self-confidence,
my self-esteem

00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:34.375
has just gone through the roof
because I can.

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:37.125
Isatou: I became more self-sufficient.

00:03:37.416 --> 00:03:41.791
I learned a lot from other people
and still did rely on people

00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:43.250
in some instances.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.291
I do feel like I rely on myself

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.791
more now than ever.

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:52.916
I don't really rely much on people anymore.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.250
James: You can do anything.
It really is based on your attitude.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.750
And you know, you have to have patience.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
That's one problem.

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:02.250
You have to accept and have patience.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.291
People have to understand
that it may take a little longer,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.000
but we can do it.

00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:10.250
[music plays]

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:18.250
Bien: It was a brief stint that I was here
and I only learned a couple of skills.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.791
And then I went out on my own
and I worked at a place called Marshalls.

00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:25.041
Initially, it was really awkward.

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:28.750
I mean, yes, it was the type of work
that I thought I wanted to do.

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:30.500
So I went in for the interview.

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:32.833
I did have an interpreter there
who explained

00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:35.875
that I had Usher syndrome
and what that meant.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:38.041
So the people at my workplace
had some training.

00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:42.375
I think it was great that they did that
because everybody seemed really friendly

00:04:42.666 --> 00:04:45.041
and all that awkwardness was sort of gone.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.416
I worked there for six years and I was
sort of the master of everything there.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.041
I knew how to do every job that was there.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.250
I'm like, ”no worries, I can do this!”

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.791
I became sort of the trainer
of everybody for stock work.

00:04:58.125 --> 00:05:00.500
You know, I was able to do
garment pressing

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.750
and I had to get up really early
to do that and I didn't care.

00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:06.250
I was psyched
that this is what I got to do.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.625
I got recognition for the work
that I was doing, I was so proud of it.

00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:15.000
I got a certificate for being
a great employee and I loved working there

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.666
and I was earning my own money

00:05:16.791 --> 00:05:18.750
and I was doing what I needed to do

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.791
to be independent
and living and work on my own.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.791
Rosanna: Work on your skills.

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:30.041
Learn your skills, know who you are,
and know what your skills are in

00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:33.916
related to the sighted world
and your sighted peers.

00:05:34.375 --> 00:05:38.625
If you do that,
you will learn to be successful.

00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:40.416
The tools are there.

00:05:40.416 --> 00:05:43.375
You just need to access the tools
from your toolbox

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.250
and use them, and that would be
the advice that I would give.

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:50.625
If you need to use an interpreter,
use an interpreter.

00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.625
If you need to use

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:56.625
large print, you can read
large print, use large print.

00:05:56.916 --> 00:06:01.875
Whatever tools you have
that are going to be in your favor

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:06.875
to help you succeed, those are
the tools that you should access and use.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:12.000
David: One of the things that is good
about disability is that it doesn't matter

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.791
what party you are, it doesn't matter
if you're rich or poor or

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.750
one color or the other
or one gender or the other.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:21.875
None of that matters.

00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:26.750
What matters is what can we do
to provide a reasonable modification

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.125
or a reasonable accommodation
to be able to get parity

00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:34.000
so that people with disabilities
can participate in all aspects of life?

00:06:34.166 --> 00:06:37.166
What public policies,
whether they be laws

00:06:37.375 --> 00:06:39.541
or regulations can we put in place

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.000
to try to improve the condition
for people with disabilities?

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.291
Because if we improve the human condition
for people with disabilities,

00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:49.125
we improve the human condition
for everybody.

00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:51.166
The rising tide lifts all ships.
