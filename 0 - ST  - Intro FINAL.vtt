00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.125
Francis: They thought that I could see.

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:06.000
I said,”no, no, no.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.125
I'm deaf and blind. I can't really see.”

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:11.250
And they just kept thinking,
“how, how is this possible?”

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.500
And I just would encourage them.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.375

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:19.750
Tony: I asked the doctor,
“am I going to become blind?”

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.250
At which the doctor said,
“yes, absolutely.”

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.375
Chris: It was hard to accept the losses,
especially my hearing.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.625
Rafael: Colors didn’t seem normal
to me as they used to,

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:29.000
they began to blur together

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.625
Francis: And to be honest with you,
I couldn't accept myself as a deaf and blind.

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:35.875

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.416
Rafael: So I went home,

00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:43.250
found some paper, found a pencil,

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:45.416
and started drawing what I saw.

00:00:45.916 --> 00:00:48.250
Tony: He put that old bike up on a bike stand.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.125
I made the necessary repairs.

00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:54.250
I called Paul over, at which point he tested
the bikeand did an inspection and said

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.625
that everything was great.
He gave me a thumbs up,

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:59.875
which I felt tactically,
and I knew I had passed his test.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.250
Francis: They didn't know that at the time

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.500
I was deaf and blind until
they met me and they said,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.125
‘”wow, you're deaf and blind?
You could act? What?”

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:10.125

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:13.375
Rafael: My name is Raphael Morales.

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:15.500
Tony: I'm Tony.
Tony Giordano.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.250
Chris: My name is Chris Cook.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.625
I'm an artist primarily working in clay.

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:22.875
Francis: My name is Dr. Francis.

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:29.000
I am a pastor to a deaf and blind
ASL congregation.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.125
Rafael: I don't think that I need to see
what something exactly

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.000
looks like for me to try to draw it.

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:37.125
And I know I'm an artist
and my art has changed.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.750
Francis: Okay. Praise God.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.125
I am a deaf and blind person,
and that's okay.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.250
And I'm happy with who I am.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.875
And I can teach. I can still tell stories.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.291
Tony: Thinking about how I had to rely on others
and how emotional that made me.

00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:54.416
I've now been able to put that aside.

00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:56.125
I've been able to gain independence.
