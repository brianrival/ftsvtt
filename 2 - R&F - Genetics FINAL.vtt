Anne: At first he wasn't sure
that we should have kids,

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.041
and I'm like, “what are you talking about?”
He's like, “well, you know,

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:12.125
what if the kids are DeafBlind?”
I mean, he had concerns.

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:14.875
“Are you going to be able to do it?”

00:00:14.875 --> 00:00:19.125
You know, and I basically did say,
“are you saying that I shouldn't be alive?”

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:22.000
I mean, we had some heated
discussions about it.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.416
Not heated, but...

00:00:24.416 --> 00:00:26.041
...well, yeah, heated.

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.125
Renee: In my family,
on my father's side,

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:40.125
there are three brothers
and sisters that have Usher.

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:42.750
Two females and an uncle.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.625
So it's a total of three individuals
who have Usher.

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:48.250
Now, in the entire family

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.375
there are seven individuals who have Usher,

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:53.875
and that includes me as well,
a younger brother,

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:57.500
and we're both deaf with Usher.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.000
Brian: When two people are carriers of Usher syndrome,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.291
it’s a recessive trait and

00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:06.875
there's about a 25% chance
of passing it on,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.875
and I happened to be the one

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:12.000
member of my family with Usher syndrome.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.500
As far as we know, nobody else in
the family has an official diagnosis

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.375
of Usher syndrome, although obviously
my parents were both carriers of it

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:25.000
and probably had family members
with it at some point.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.250
So I happened to be the lucky one that has it.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.125
[music plays]

00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:38.041
Renee: So before we got married,

00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:41.916
I do want to say thatwe went
to several workshops on Usher.

00:01:41.916 --> 00:01:44.166
They gave us genetic
counseling as well.

00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:48.166
So we both did that together
and we did our research

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:51.916
because we said, “what if we decide
to have children someday?”

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:57.416
So we started to get a lot of information
on genetics, learned a lot.

00:01:57.416 --> 00:01:59.791
And my wife actually,

00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:01.916
her genetics are dominant.

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.416
I have the recessive gene,

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:08.041
so there's a less chance or probability
that they will have Usher.

00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:11.916
But at the same time I'm a carrier,

00:02:11.916 --> 00:02:16.166
I have 25% possibility that a
child would come out with Usher.

00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:20.416
Anne: My husband is sighted
and hearing, he's a mechanic.

00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:22.166
You know, we talked about having kids.

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.083
He was nervous about it.

00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:26.791
He thought we should
have genetic testing.

00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:28.791
And, a couple of things:

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:32.791
one is, I said, “both parents have
to have Usher syndrome,

00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:38.041
and you do not, you know,
so we'll be fine.”

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:41.416
But also I was kind of like...

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:43.291
...I would still be born.

00:02:43.291 --> 00:02:47.166
I would still want to be born and
have my life, even if I had known,

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:51.041
you know, my life is still worth it
and I still love my life and I have a great life.

00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:53.541
So, you know, I wouldn't

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:59.041
not have a kid because
they have Usher syndrome.

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:02.291
I think it was a concern
to my husband, Jason,

00:03:02.791 --> 00:03:06.666
to me, it wasn't really a concern.

00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:11.666
And I don't know if that’s good
or bad or normal, I just...

00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:16.291
Brian: After conception with the first child,

00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:21.291
we did do the genetic test and
she’s not a carrier of Usher syndrome.

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:24.291
It did not affect our decision
whether or not to have a child.

00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:27.166
We went forward with the decision

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.166
knowing that it was a possibility.

00:03:30.666 --> 00:03:33.541
I'm currently married with two daughters

00:03:33.541 --> 00:03:36.291
and, as far as we know,
our daughters don't have it either.

00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:42.166
Everyone in my life is typically sighted
and typically hearing.

00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:45.916
Renee: I have four children
and they're not DeafBlind.

00:03:45.916 --> 00:03:47.416
They're all hearing

00:03:47.416 --> 00:03:49.291
They're all hearing
and they're good.

00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:52.416
[music plays]

00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:58.291
Brian: I live a happy and fulfilling life.

00:03:58.291 --> 00:04:03.041
And so, if I had a child with DeafBlindness,
I would be perfectly okay with that.

00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:05.291
And this might not be a popular opinion,

00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:07.541
but I think for me there is

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:12.166
a sense of pride in being DeafBlind.

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:16.791
It would have been nice
to have a child with DeafBlindness.

00:04:17.541 --> 00:04:20.666
There are things I've learned
throughout my lifetime

00:04:20.666 --> 00:04:23.541
that I could share with that particular child.

00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:28.916
In a lot of ways they relate to their mother
more in the way that they do things.

00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:32.416
Renee: They would be a part of the
deaf community, you know,

00:04:32.416 --> 00:04:35.916
if they were deaf, then they could
relate to me, so that’s...

00:04:36.541 --> 00:04:37.666
...that's good.

00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:40.416
If they were DeafBlind,

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:42.916
I'm not sure.

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:45.541
I have so many experiences.

00:04:45.666 --> 00:04:48.416
I have the pros and the cons of both.

00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:51.791
So it's definitely a tough life to navigate,

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.791
being DeafBlind,

00:04:54.041 --> 00:04:57.791
so I'm not sure what to answer.

00:04:57.791 --> 00:04:59.541
Anne: I didn't have concerns that my kids

00:04:59.541 --> 00:05:02.541
were going to have Usher syndrome or be DeafBlind.

00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:03.791
I really didn't.

00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:06.041
I think,

00:05:06.291 --> 00:05:09.416
knowing that I grew up,
I had an amazing family,

00:05:09.416 --> 00:05:13.916
I was blessed. I had an amazing
upport system and I grew up fine.

00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:18.791
And I do know people who
won't have kids because of it,

00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:21.416
and to me that's sad.

00:05:21.416 --> 00:05:23.416
I guess I understand they're scared,

00:05:23.416 --> 00:05:25.916
they're worried about the challenges,
and I'm not going to lie,

00:05:25.916 --> 00:05:30.416
I mean, there are some challenges
that make it more difficult, but I wouldn't

00:05:31.041 --> 00:05:32.041
change it.
