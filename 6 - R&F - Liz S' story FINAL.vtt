00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.291
Liz: My mom kind of
viewed people who are DeafBlind

00:00:05.291 --> 00:00:07.000
as not being able to.

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:09.916
They were kind of just awkward about it.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.041
And my mom kept on saying, “I can't”

00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:15.750
That word: ‘I can’t’, you know...

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:17.875
it's just inappropriate.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.125
I can have children.

00:00:23.416 --> 00:00:26.750
[music plays]

00:00:29.916 --> 00:00:31.625
When I was about 26 years old

00:00:31.625 --> 00:00:33.375
and I first became pregnant,

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.375
and that was my first boy, Brian.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.125
And we were all jumping for joy
that he was born.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:42.125
But there were some problems that
popped up with my mother specifically.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.000
Communication with her was a little dicey.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.625
She wanted a little bit more control, I think,

00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:50.000
of the situation and my baby.

00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:53.375
She, of course, would appreciate
me giving her a grandchild.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But there was like this control element
that was happening

00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:58.500
and things were getting messed up.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.750
She was complaining a lot,
a lot of denial related to me having kids.

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:05.875
That was the issue.

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:09.000

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.250
The Mass Commission for the Blind

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.791
basically stated that I’m older than 22,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.125
my parents don't need to be involved.

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:20.375
I can be independent and do what I want.

00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:24.000
So I am not unfit and I have the right
to have a child.

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:26.625
I can have children and raise them.

00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:32.041
It seems like my parents maybe they didn't
understand that fully when I was having children

00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:35.166
because I'm DeafBlind and older than 22

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:37.541
I still have the same rights
as other people.

00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:40.666
But most of our parents are hearing.

00:01:41.416 --> 00:01:43.416
They don't understand DeafBlind people.

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:46.166
They don't understand the culture
and the community.

00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:51.791
So when my son was with her growing up,
they didn't teach him sign language.

00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:54.041
They didn't really care
about communication.

00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:55.416
And that was a problem.

00:01:57.041 --> 00:01:58.916
I wanted to know what
was going on with my son

00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:00.666
while my mom had custody over him.

00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:03.541
And she wasn't really good
at communicating with me

00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:07.791
to let me know about the daily events
and things that were happening in his life.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.166
And I felt very disconnected.

00:02:10.416 --> 00:02:13.666
[music plays]

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:18.166
So I went to MCB,

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:22.166
and I asked them, you know,
“I need some help, I need some support.”

00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:24.916
What can I utilize in the area?

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:27.916
And there was this new
mother’s class that was set up.

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:30.291
And I went there for about four years,

00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:31.541
and I didn't give up.

00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:33.416
I just kept going.

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:37.041
I kept persevering and
taking different classes with them

00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:40.291
and learning more and more about parents
and how to raise children.

00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:42.541
I had difficulties seeing,

00:02:42.708 --> 00:02:45.916
but I had special equipment, like an alarm
that would let me know

00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:49.916
that the baby's crying. It picks up
sound, and I would look for that.

00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:53.291
And when I was changing the baby
or the baby was signing with me,

00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:55.916
you know, I'd pay attention to the baby.

00:02:56.666 --> 00:03:00.291
And as they grew up,
it became easier and easier.

00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:02.291
I wasn't afraid.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:04.666
When I had my second son

00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:08.958
and I was pregnant, my mom really
didn't doubt me anymore or judge me.

00:03:09.416 --> 00:03:13.333
The third child, the same thing,
didn't really have an issue either.

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:15.291
We had a happy little family.

00:03:15.291 --> 00:03:17.291
It was better than in the past.

00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:20.791
[music plays]

00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:26.041
My first child is Brian.

00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:27.666
He's my oldest.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.041
He's 31 years old.

00:03:29.541 --> 00:03:31.416
And my second child is Sean,

00:03:31.416 --> 00:03:33.166
and they are about 20.

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:35.166
And my last daughter,

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:37.041
she's about 18 years old.

00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:39.916
All three of them are hearing.

00:03:40.208 --> 00:03:41.541
(music plays)

00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:43.041
My daughter and my sons

00:03:43.041 --> 00:03:44.541
they’d go in corn mazes with me,

00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:47.291
we’d go on tractors, we’d go apple picking.

00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:48.958
We’d go out to dinner.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.375
And we’d go and actually meet my mother,
who's older and my older brother

00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:54.500
and his girlfriend.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.000
And we’d all get together

00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:58.750
and it is was lot of fun.

00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:02.500
Most parents who are hearing

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.125
they don't have deaf parents class, you know,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.875
like raising children
that are deaf.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.500
And in 1984 they set something up,
and that is more fair.

00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:15.666
So hearing parents,
they have their own way of doing things.

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:19.125
But deaf parents, they need equality too.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:21.541
