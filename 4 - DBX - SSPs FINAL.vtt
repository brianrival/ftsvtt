00:00:03.125 --> 00:00:05.125
Rebecca: So when you think about
somebody, let's say

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:08.000
they have a really busy work week
and then on the weekends

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.875
they catch up on all the errands
that they need to do.

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:13.625
They go to the dry cleaner,
they need to go buy a pair of shoes.

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:15.750
They have all of these things
that they need to do.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.625
They don't think twice about
whether they're going to be able to do it.

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:21.500
It’s just a matter of whether they're
going to have enough time

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.625
to get all the things
that they want to do.

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:24.375
But what if these are

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:28.250
all of the things that you need to do,
all these errands you need to run,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.541
but in order to run them,
you need somebody else to be with you

00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:35.125
to make sure that
you're able to navigate safely.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.750
[music plays]

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:47.000
Sarah: SSP, what that stands for is
Support Service Provider.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.750
That term emerged quite a while ago,

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:56.000
I think it was from AADB
American Association of the DeafBlind.

00:00:56.375 --> 00:01:00.125
And so what they did
was they recognized the need for an SSP

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:05.625
to accompany the DeafBlind individual
so they would have a sighted person

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.000
co-navigate with the DeafBlind individual.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:13.375
Alice: Part of what they do
is also give you environmental cues.

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:18.375
Say we walk into a room,
they give you the landscape, so to speak.

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:20.750
Give you an idea who's there.

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:24.250
If you're looking for somebody
in particular, they can be honing in

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.250
to find that.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.875
They can also give me haptic
cues on my back or on my shoulder.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.625
For instance, if I'm talking to somebody
but they’re on their phone

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:35.250
not really listening,
I get to know all that too.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.375
Rocky: The SSP is not there to enable a person.

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:41.000
They're not there to do things for them.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
They're there to do things with them.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.375
And so there are limitations
and restrictions on what an SSP

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:49.041
can do for them.

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:51.625
Sarah: The DeafBlind individual
would make a request.

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:55.000
Perhaps they're going to a doctor's office,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.500
maybe they need to go
food shopping, go to the dentist,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.666
or maybe they just want to go out
to the park for a walk.

00:02:02.666 --> 00:02:08.500
Alice: I use them a lot actually,
for social stuff that I do.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.500
You know, for instance,
if it's a bingo game

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.000
or we're doing Family Feud
and they keep me on point

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.250
so I know who's saying what, when
and what's going on

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.375
in the chat window when I can only monitor
one thing at a time.

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:25.375
So they also can help with phone calls
and lots of other things.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.875
So that role is pretty intense.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.000
My first SSP went surfing with me,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.375
probably laughed at me for a while
because she didn't think

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:38.625
I was serious until I was like,
“yeah, I'm really going surfing.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:40.125
How are we going to play this?”

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:42.750
And, you know, that took a lot of practice

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.750
and stuff, but it's client led,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.500
you know, they don't do anything
that we don't ask them to.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.250
They give you as much
information as I want

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.125
and as much detail as I need.

00:02:56.875 --> 00:03:01.625
And if I'm actually holding my own,
they can also step back and just let it go.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.875
Renee: You know, there's new vocabulary
coming out for the SSP role.

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:08.000
There's a new term called “co...”

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.250
Oh, I hope I get this right, “navigator.”

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.750
I don't know if
I spelled that correctly,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.000
but basically they provide support.

00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:19.250
They provide support
and services that are needed

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.750
by DeafBlind individuals,
and these SSPs or co-navigators,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.250
have the skills.
They can sign with sign language

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.875
and they provide environmental
information of what's around.

00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:32.250
For example, if I'm going into a store

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.750
and I'd like to go shopping,

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.500
I'll get everything in my cart
and I’ll go to the cashier

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.750
and the cashier will say, okay, here's
how much this is going to cost.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.750
The SSP tells me that. I pull out my card

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.625
put the pin number in the machine.

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.375
So it's really like communication facilitation.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.791
Sarah: I do want to take a moment here
to explain the difference

00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:57.000
between SSP and interpreter
because they are two completely different roles.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.250
An SSP is a person that
provides visual information.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.250
That's what their role is.

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:10.625
While an interpreter is there
to provide access to communication.

00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:16.750
So a lot of people think, Oh, well,
the SSP, they can interpret too.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.125
And so then they ask the SSP to interpret.

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:22.166
Please do not do that. That is not their role.

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:24.291
[music plays]

00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:32.041
Rocky: There are two categories of SSPs.

00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:36.916
So there are personally trained SSPs
and then there are professionally trained SSPs.

00:04:37.791 --> 00:04:41.166
Professionally trained SSPs,
they work through a particular program

00:04:41.166 --> 00:04:45.666
and they are trained in what they are
and are not allowed to do.

00:04:45.666 --> 00:04:49.416
And they function as a professional
in a professional role,

00:04:49.416 --> 00:04:54.791
and they are there to empower
the individual that they’re working with.

00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:59.291
A personal SSP would be no different than me,

00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:02.041
for example, having a family member

00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:05.666
or a close friend going with me to a store

00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:08.916
or driving me to a different place

00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:14.916
to assist me in completing a task
such as reading my mail or going

00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:18.041
grocery shopping
or even facilitating communication.

00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:21.916
Sarah: Today, there are
some states out there

00:05:21.916 --> 00:05:26.458
that do have SSP services and programs,
but not a lot of states.

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:30.666
So it would be nice if all of the states
in the country recognized

00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:36.541
the need just to have
co-navigators available as a resource.

00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:39.041
Rocky: For anyone who is DeafBlind

00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:42.041
You can reach out
and see if your state has a program.

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.041
Some states, unfortunately, do not.

00:05:44.041 --> 00:05:48.291
But there are other services that you can
access if you don't have access to that.

00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:50.791
And as long as they're used correctly,
they can be very fulfilling

00:05:50.791 --> 00:05:53.666
for an individual
who is DeafBlind to gain access.

00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:55.666
Renee: As a DeafBlind individual,

00:05:55.666 --> 00:05:59.916
if we’re going into a store with no SSP,
there's no communication for us.

00:06:00.166 --> 00:06:01.916
How would I be able to shop?

00:06:01.916 --> 00:06:06.500
I can't do that independently
without someone like an SSP by my side

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.750
I have to have that.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.750
It’s much more of an exciting opportunity
for us to have those services.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.625
I cannot wait until they really start.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.458
