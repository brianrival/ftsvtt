00:00:03.083 --> 00:00:05.125
Bien: I thought I was disabled.

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:07.041
And I didn't know what was going on.

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:11.500
But when they gave me this
visual language, this way to communicate,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.333
it was like a fire was lit inside of me.

00:00:18.083 --> 00:00:20.333
Rosanna: I wanted to be like everybody else.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:22.875
I wanted to do what everybody else did.

00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:28.458
Korrine: They pretty much wanted to decide for me
what I could and could not do.

00:00:28.583 --> 00:00:29.500
That's up to me.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.708
Chris: It's challenging, honestly, for DeafBlind
people to begin their journey

00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:39.208
in employment, to just get onto
the first rung of the ladder.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:41.875
Linda: There are people out there
that won't give us a chance.

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:43.791
Shame on them.

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:50.708
Rocky: People who are DeafBlind
and have accomplished many, many things.

00:00:50.708 --> 00:00:55.083
We have the same goals, the same interests,
the same attitudes, the same aptitudes.

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:59.000
James: Everybody learns in their own way,
and we have to accept that.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.958
That's simply life.

00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:03.000
And that goes the same for the work world.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.708
You have to find out what
you can do and do your best.

Isatou: My name is Isatou Sankanu.

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:26.291
I was pretty awkward in the beginning.

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:28.250
I learned a lot from other people.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.083
Linda: I'm just a normal person
doing a normal job.

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:37.125
Linda: I don't usually brag,
but I'm just really good at what I do.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.916
Rosanna: Having a disability does not mean
that you can't be successful.

00:01:41.916 --> 00:01:44.208
It's just the opposite.

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:47.250
Bien: I got recognition for the work
that I was doing.

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:48.583
Iâ€™m so proud of it.

00:01:48.583 --> 00:01:49.750
James: I really like it.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.375
And you know,
my self-confidence, my self-esteem

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:54.750
has just gone through
the roof because I can.
