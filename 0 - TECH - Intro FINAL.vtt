00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:06.500
Bapin: The devices we use now have become
smaller and smaller.

00:00:06.916 --> 00:00:09.875
Nothing is the 20 pounds of years ago.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.416
Now our devices are
as light as a pound or less.

00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:16.375
So times have changed.

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:18.375

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:23.958
Bryan: Assistive technology
is a kind of tool or system

00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:27.791
to give us access in our
everyday lives and our workplace

00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:30.833
to level the playing field
with our able-bodied peers.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.958
Chris: Without assistive technology,

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.375
I would not have been able
to teach very well.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:39.500
Scott: It comes back to now I have
equal access to the information.

00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:41.791
Equal access to communication.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:45.916
And I'm able to be
the person that I want to be.

00:00:45.916 --> 00:00:49.166

00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:54.125
Scott: I have my braille
display paired to my iPhone.

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:59.791
Chris: I can use the camera to zoom in on the
label and read the words much more easily.

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:03.000
Bapin: I could write on paper,
but I couldn't read.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.666
Using the Perkins Brailler to type braille

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:07.625
meant that I could review
what I was writing.

00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:09.416
I was thrilled.

00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:10.875

00:01:11.416 --> 00:01:12.875
Chris: My name is Chris Woodfill.

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:14.375
Scott: Hi, my name is Scott Davert.

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:16.000
Bryan: My name is Bryan Ward.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.250
Bapin: I am Anindya Bhattacharyya.

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:21.875
But I am more often
known by my nickname, Bapin.

00:01:21.875 --> 00:01:25.000
Bryan: Honestly, for me,
without assistive technology,

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:27.166
my life would be very isolated.

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:28.500
Scott: It connects me with people.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.000
It makes me feel more included in society
than just sitting home doing nothing.

00:01:34.125 --> 00:01:37.291
Technology, thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:40.875
I now feel like I'm
more of a full person again.
