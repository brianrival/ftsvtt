00:00:05.708 --> 00:00:08.791
Carl: Find the chair.
Find the chair. Find the chair.

00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:11.375
Oh, he’s trying to avoid it,
he doesn't want me to walk into it.

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:14.000
Come on, find the chair. Find the chair.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.625
Come on.

00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:17.500
I just bragged about your ability.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.375
[music plays]

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:31.666
Good boy.

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:32.541
[Loud beep]

00:00:33.625 --> 00:00:34.500
Forward.

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:36.000
I have my buddy here,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Merrick, who’s 11 years old.

00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:40.541
He’s my third guide dog.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.500
I also use a white came
when I need to,

00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:47.041
but I prefer guide dog travel.

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:51.125
When we’re just walking and
he understands me with a few gestures

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:53.041
and I know what he’s telling me.

00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:56.750
We're just communicating seamlessly
and we're just working

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.166
well together as a team.

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:01.250
And he’s just getting me
from point A to point B

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.875
without any hassle,
and it's just an unbelievable feeling.

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:07.041
Ok, good boy.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.375
Okay, yeah, alright, you did good.

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:11.375
I take the bus

00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:13.500
and the subway
since I live here in Boston.

00:01:14.125 --> 00:01:16.791
I take the 57 bus to Kenmore station

00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:18.416
and then I get on

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:21.625
the green line subway to Park Street,
and then walk to the State House.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:24.041
And that’s about
an hour each way for me.

00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:26.875
[wind blowing]

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.541
“Third floor”

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:37.375
Ok, forward, right.

00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:45.791
My name is Carl Richardson, and I am the
Massachusetts State House ADA coordinator

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:50.375
where it is my role to ensure
that all programs, services, and activities

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:54.250
at the Massachusetts State House
are accessible to people of all abilities.

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:59.000
I work closely with the legislature,
the executive branch, and stakeholders

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.541
from the disability community
to ensure that everyone has full access.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.000
What's the matter, buddy?

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:09.125
I don't want to go back to the elevator.

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:10.541
Okay, left. There we go.

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:15.416
Yes, yes, I put a rail in there.

00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:17.500
There didn’t use to be a rail in there.

00:02:17.916 --> 00:02:18.875
Is that Michael?

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:20.000
Michael: It’s Mike and Karen.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.500
Carl: Oh, my two favorites.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.625
I’m a star, didn’t you know?

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:24.625
Michael: We always knew.

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:29.625
How do people feel experientially
when they walk into a building?

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:30.916
Hello, Trooper.

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:31.375
Trooper: Hi!

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:32.083
Carl: How are you?

00:02:32.083 --> 00:02:32.750
Trooper: I’m well.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.958
Can I go in there?

00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:34.625
Trooper: Yes sir.

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:35.791
Carl: Alright, thank you.

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.250
I, as a person with a disability,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.166
might overlook a sign
not having braille,

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:47.750
but do I feel welcome and respected
when I enter a building?

00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:52.250
Do the staff talk to me with respect?

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.500
Do they say,
“Hey, can I help you?”

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:57.125
So there are a number of
areas that I look at

00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:59.916
when in terms of accessibility
of the State House.

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:01.625
It could be physical access,

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:04.250
whether rooms
are physically accessible.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.375
So I could be working on capital projects

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:11.125
such as upgrading rooms for wheelchair
accessibility, that sort of thing.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.291
All right.

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:18.500
We are now in the Senate Chambers..

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.041
Some of the access features
that we did in this room

00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:24.250
when we redid the room
a few years ago is,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.666
these desks are old and historic,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.625
and we were worried about cutting them up
and taking away the historic integrity

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:32.250
of the desks. So
how could we make them

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.125
accessible to wheelchair users
without ruining the desk?

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.666
So we simply put a false bottom
on the desk

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:40.250
and raised them slightly.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.166
They’re user-friendly so that
people can use them

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:45.750
and they will maintain
the historic integrity of what they are.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.791
Absolutely.

00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:50.875
We also have induction coil loop in this rug
for those who are hard of hearing.

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:55.375
So you can either wear ALD,
assistive listening device receivers

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:59.666
or someone like myself can simply click
a switch on their hearing aid

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:03.125
and then somebody is speaking into the sound system
and it goes directly into their hearing aid.

00:04:03.625 --> 00:04:06.125
This room is 225 years old,

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.416
and yet we found ways to make this room
more friendly to people with disabilities.

00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:14.666
[traffic souds]

00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:16.791
[music plays]

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:20.458
Some of the things we are
advocating for

00:04:20.458 --> 00:04:24.166
is transportation access issues,

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:27.875
internet affordability
for people with disabilities,

00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:30.750
sidewalk repair and installation

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.875
of audible pedestrian signals.

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:37.625
We're just advocating for the same things
that everybody else wants.

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:42.375
We just want to have a normal life
and the ability to have all those things,

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:44.625
and that's all we really want.

00:04:44.625 --> 00:04:47.583
