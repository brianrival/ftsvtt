00:00:03.125 --> 00:00:08.291
Lydia: I have noticed that a lot of people
are now understanding the importance

00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:13.250
of saying, “someone who's DeafBlind”
instead of just “DeafBlind people.”

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:17.666
It just really helps us
be more integrated into society

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:22.541
and normalizing us as
people first, instead of

00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:25.375
just someone who has a disability.

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:28.291
Our disability does not define who we are.

00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.625
It just happens to be part of us.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.916
We are people first.

00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:36.500
[music plays]

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.541
Rocky: The Helen Keller National Center
made a major change in language

00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:51.291
that took years,
if not decades, to approve.

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:53.583
when you wrote the word DeafBlind

00:00:53.583 --> 00:00:56.291
it was a lowercase d

00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:00.000
and slash and then lowercase b,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750
And so it's like deaf slash
blind, essentially.

00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:07.041
And I think it was as of August of 2021

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:12.000
when Helen Keller Services
officially adopted

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.875
the term “DeafBlind” with no slash,

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:20.291
capital D, capital B, all one word.

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:25.500
Alice: It's not like we're blind first and deaf
second or deaf first and blind...

00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:27.500
It doesn't matter.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.791
Those two things live in one body
and I actually have buttons

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:36.541
that say, “yes, I'm deaf and blind,”
so they can see the big “and”

00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:39.750
because it's not one or the other,

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.250
and one isn't bigger or better.

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:46.291
Having the word be together is a unifier.

00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:49.500
Rocky: The other thing too,
that I think can happen

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:54.083
when you start drawing lines
within the DeafBlind community

00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:58.791
and even just the blind community, is that
you begin to create this hierarchies.

00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:02.958
And I see these a lot in the educational
setting, special education setting,

00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.250
even somewhat into the workforce

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.916
where people who are DeafBlind

00:02:07.916 --> 00:02:11.416
are placed on this hierarchy, so to speak.

00:02:11.416 --> 00:02:13.666
And I think that's
a very dangerous approach

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.250
because what tends to happen is those
who are at the top of the hierarchy

00:02:19.416 --> 00:02:21.625
or in the middle don't necessarily

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:24.666
get the same services
as those at the bottom.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.500
One of the things that I have frequently
said is that I'm very fortunate that I'm

00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:33.791
someone who is totally blind
because had I not been totally blind,

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:36.625
if I had even tunnel vision, even just,

00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:38.250
you know, two degrees of vision,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.375
the odds of my family having to fight
my school district tooth and nail

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.000
to ensure that I received braille services
would have increased significantly.

00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:50.666
I can't tell you how many hundreds,

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:54.500
if not thousands of stories
I have heard in the blind community

00:02:54.875 --> 00:02:59.750
where young children
in the school system or even adults

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.875
who are, for all intents and purposes blind

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.625
or DeafBlind but have
a small amount of vision

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:11.000
and hearing, are refused
necessary services.

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:12.916
They’re refused an interpreter.

00:03:13.416 --> 00:03:16.125
They’re refused the
opportunity to learn braille.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.125
And I think
if we would just recognize that

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:22.041
rather than creating these levels,

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:27.000
we would have a much, much better society

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.125
and much more integration
into society for ourselves.

00:03:30.625 --> 00:03:35.666
Lydia: Regarding adequate services
for the DeafBlind community based on

00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:39.916
a level or degree of DeafBlindness,
I think that's critically important.

00:03:39.916 --> 00:03:44.000
In my personal experience being that
I am mostly deaf in my right ear,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.708
but have decent hearing in the left,

00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:50.375
I think the degree of my hearing loss or

00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:53.666
lack of ability to understand

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:56.125
speech was not fully understood in school,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.625
and as a result
I did not have adequate tools.

00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:07.250
For example, I did not have access
to hearing aid technology.

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:10.791
Most of the time when I was in school,

00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:15.625
it was just really difficult
for me to hear and to participate.

00:04:15.625 --> 00:04:21.125
I also didn't have transcripts
and things like that most of the time.

00:04:21.125 --> 00:04:26.291
And so I think that really illustrates
the importance of why,

00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:29.541
even though someone
seemingly has, you know

00:04:29.875 --> 00:04:34.000
quote good enough hearing or
good enough sight to perform the task

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:37.500
without many modifications
or accommodations,

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.041
I think it's really important
to evaluate all available options

00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:46.250
because maybe they can do
something but at the same time

00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:50.000
what if they can do it
better with a simple tool

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:55.250
such as a hearing aid
that you barely even see in someone’s ear.

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:59.500
And I know a lot of times
there's also the argument that,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.166
“oh well, it's too expensive, or
not enough people are going to benefit,

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:07.041
so why should we provide this service?”

00:05:07.041 --> 00:05:09.291
And my counter argument to that would be,

00:05:09.291 --> 00:05:14.041
sure, there isn't a
massive DeafBlind population.

00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:18.041
Of course the sighted and hearing
population is bigger.

00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:22.250
But at the same time,
we as the DeafBlind community

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.166
have so much to offer society,
and if we're given the proper tools

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.666
to succeed and the proper supports
that we need to thrive,

00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:34.875
we can contribute so much to society.

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:35.750
And so I think even though short term
it may seem burdensome to a school,

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.916
And so I think even though short term
it may seem burdensome to a school

00:05:39.916 --> 00:05:43.166
or a company or a business or what have you,

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:45.416
long term, the benefits

00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:49.500
of providing adequate supports
and services

00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:53.125
strongly and very much outweigh

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:57.750
any short term burdens they may face.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.708
