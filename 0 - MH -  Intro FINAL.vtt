00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.500
Rebecca: It's not so much the
physical implications of going deaf and blind.

00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:10.125
What I always felt
was just a sense of not really belonging.

00:00:10.666 --> 00:00:13.291
I felt like there was something
fundamentally wrong with me.

00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:15.500
There was so much shame
that came with that.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.125
There was a lot of isolation.

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:18.958
There was a lot of hiding.

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:20.375

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:24.458
Fatou: I have seen and come across

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:27.625
a lot of DeafBlind people
tucked away from society.

00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:31.041
Korrine: I ended up losing a lot of my
friends because everyone

00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:35.000
kind of saw me as different and of course
they didn't know what to expect.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.916
Neither did I, but it hurt.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.000
Rebecca: Everybody is able to do
all of these things

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.750
that I am progressively
no longer able to do.

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:46.500
And these are things
people don't want to think about.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.791
Alice: Mental health.
Big, big, big deal.

00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:51.041
Keeping it, bigger deal.

00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:52.375
Finding a therapist?

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.500
That's a serious adventure.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.416
Rebecca: I think in that process
of starting to see these

00:00:57.416 --> 00:01:01.291
less from a place of what I can't do
and what I'm not

00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:06.208
and working more towards
what I can do, what I can learn.

Fatou: My name is Fatou Sankanu.

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:14.208
Korrine: My name is Korrine Herlth.

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:15.500
Alice: My name is Alice Eaddy.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:17.000
Rebecca: Iâ€™m Rebecca Alexander.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.125
I am a psychotherapist, an author

00:01:20.458 --> 00:01:25.041
I want people to develop the comfort
with understanding that mental health

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:29.250
very much drives who we are
and how we interact with the world

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.416
and how we see ourselves.

00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:32.125
Korrine: I can do this.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:35.125
Just because I'm blind
doesn't mean I can't.

00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:38.125
Fatou: Really, It's any time when
you're feeling under the gun

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.500
or you feel like you want to give up,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.250
remind yourself it's going to be okay.

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:45.416
Alice: It's okay.

00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:47.875
I'll grow on you or I'll make you nuts.

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.666
But, you know...

00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:51.500
...that's the way life is.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
It's meant to be lived.
