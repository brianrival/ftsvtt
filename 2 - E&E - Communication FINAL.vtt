Chris: In eduation communication
is required by law

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.416
and what I mean to say
is that communication access is required

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:15.125
under the law in these settings
of employment and education.

00:00:15.416 --> 00:00:17.500
Can you share your experiences

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.625
of communication access at work
or in a post-secondary setting?

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:23.625
Who would like to start
with that question?

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:28.791
[music plays]

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.125
Nathalie: I graduated from
Sacred Heart University

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:40.750
with a sociology degree

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.416
and at the school there was a
department for people with disabilities.

00:00:48.875 --> 00:00:51.750
And when I was applying,

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.625
I didn't know what I needed.

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:56.166
I relied a lot on my vision

00:00:56.625 --> 00:01:00.750
and on the FM system,
which is the microphone.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.791
I just wanted to fit in
with the other students.

00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:09.875
And that was basically what mattered
to me the most at that time.

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:15.750
And when I started college,
long story short,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.666
they didn't know how to work with somebody
who was DeafBlind.

00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:23.750
It was hard. It was difficult.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.750
It took me a long time to read pages
and I couldn't finish all the lectures

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.625
and I was struggling in school.

00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:36.166
As time goes on
I was like, you know what?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.500
I think it's time for me
to change my habits of technology

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.250
and try something else.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.291
So I started learning
using a screen reader on my computer

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:52.375
and over time it’s been very

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:56.291
helpful and I was able to navigate school.

00:01:56.291 --> 00:02:00.666
It actually helped me
a lot more to get to work

00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:04.500
more effectively in the workforce

00:02:04.875 --> 00:02:06.666
And I love it.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.750
Adriana: I made the decision to go back to college
because I wanted to change my life,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.625
but I knew that
it would be a challenge for me.

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:17.916
I applied to the New York
Institute of Technology

00:02:17.916 --> 00:02:19.791
with a major in social work.

00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:22.500
We met with the disability
counselor at the college

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.000
to talk about what my needs would be.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.375
It seems like we had
all the accommodations worked out.

00:02:27.375 --> 00:02:29.500
I was excited and I was ready.

00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:32.875
On my first day,
I walked into my first class

00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:36.791
with my two interpreters,
and I will never forget the look

00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:39.875
that that instructor gave me
when she saw me and my cane.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.041
In fact, she asked why I was there.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.541
I had to explain that I was her student.

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.750
She gave me such a look.

00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:54.416
Class began and the interpreter started
interpreting and switching each other out.

00:02:54.666 --> 00:02:56.791
Once again, she looked over.

00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:59.625
She started yelling at us
to stop chatting.

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:03.625
The interpreter let her know
that we were simply interpreting,

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:08.000
explaining that I was DeafBlind and
getting the lecture through the interpreters.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.125
I was embarrassed,
but I really had to bite my tongue.

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.500
It was a frustrating first day.

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:16.375
When I took my first exam

00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:19.125
I did get extended time,
which was a relief.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.125
The interpreter would read the questions
to me because I couldn't see the print,

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:28.166
and the instructor refused to make it
accessible using large print.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.041
What a waste of my time.

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:32.500
I got through the exam

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.250
and the teacher emailed me later

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.500
saying that I got the top grade
on the exam and apologized

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.500
for ignoring my communication
and accommodation needs.

00:03:43.041 --> 00:03:47.166
She couldn't believe that
I had gotten a 98% on the exam.

00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:49.500
She was operating under the assumption

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.666
that DeafBlind meant dumb.

00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:56.416
I asked not to have a repeat
of what happened that last semester.

00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:58.916
She assured me that
it would not happen again

00:03:58.916 --> 00:04:01.833
and apologized for all the screw ups.

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:06.541
It was so successful and
I was so much happier in that semester.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.875
I didn't have any issues.

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:10.250
I no longer kept that to myself.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.041
I was proud of what I could do.

00:04:12.916 --> 00:04:14.500
I was a success.

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:17.250
Scott: When I went to college,

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.166
they didn't really know
what to do with me either.

00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:24.666
Quite frankly, I didn't know what
to do with me either, in the beginning.

00:04:24.916 --> 00:04:27.000
But what I learned was

00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:28.416
that I had to figure it out.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.916
Even though my hearing
was getting to the point that I could

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:34.958
no longer understand the books on tape,

00:04:34.958 --> 00:04:39.750
I couldn’t understand them
and I told the Disability Services Office

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.125
that I couldn't use audiobooks anymore.

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:47.375
I had to have these things in a digital
format that I could read in braille.

00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:49.541
They come back with, “well,

00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:53.125
can you drop the class
you're in temporarily and then pick it up

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.958
so that we can get your books ready
in an accessible format

00:04:56.958 --> 00:05:02.166
because we have to figure out
how to do it.” I said absolutely not.

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:03.875
No way.

00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:06.125
I am not falling behind my peers.

00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:09.000
I'm not going to sit here
for a longer duration of time

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.166
simply because you don't
know how to accommodate me.’

00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:17.250
So I went and I scanned my own books
and turned them into the format I needed.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.166
And it was a lot of extra time,
but that's what I had to do

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:21.125
And it was a lot of extra time,
but that's what I had to do

00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:23.625
Not only did
I understand that I was capable

00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:27.750
of figuring things out
even without the support of others,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.250
that it was okay
to put people in their place.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.416
And I, you know,

00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:36.625
I really learned a lot from that
and so many of the other experiences

00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:39.875
that the world can't

00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:43.375
always adapt to me, it's my situation.

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:45.500
I have to adapt to the world.

00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:49.625
Chris: It wasn't until I began my first
master’s degree

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.250
where things became challenging.

00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:56.000
For the first time, I was in an
all-hearing educational environment

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.625
where I was the only DeafBlind student.

00:05:58.125 --> 00:05:59.500
My very first semester

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.375
during the class, the professor explained

00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:03.791
a project that was going to be completed

00:06:03.791 --> 00:06:07.125
regarding the diplomatic history
between the United States

00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:10.375
and Latin America,
which was the title of the course.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.791
The teacher required that we come up
after class and take 30 seconds

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:18.541
or so to share the country
and the event we would select.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.166
and so finally it was my turn
and through the interpreter

00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:25.375
I explained that I was going
to choose the Panama Canal.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.541
After explaining my project,

00:06:27.541 --> 00:06:30.750
the professor said, ‘please
write on the blackboard

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.125
what you've just said to me.’

00:06:32.916 --> 00:06:37.250
So I asked the professor, ‘why would
I have to write it on the blackboard?’

00:06:37.625 --> 00:06:41.416
His response was,
“I know that monkey language

00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:44.541
can't be so sophisticated
as to be able to convey

00:06:44.541 --> 00:06:48.125
the sophisticated concepts
that you actually said to me.”

00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:50.916
I was in disbelief.

00:06:51.416 --> 00:06:55.291
At the time I was about 22 years old
and I didn't know what to do next.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.666
This course was my first class

00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:02.250
and my first semester of graduate
school at a hearing university.

00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:04.416
So I wrote it out on the blackboard,

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:05.791
at length.

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:10.500
And in reading what I wrote, his response
was to approve my project topic,

00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:13.625
and he noted that I
could continue in the course.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.625
I received an A in that course.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.625
In fact, I received an
A-plus in that course.

00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:24.000
And when I showed the professor
my grade in that course,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.750
he was shocked to learn
that I received an A-plus.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.750
In fact, he told me that I had gotten the
highest grade of anyone in that course.

00:07:32.791 --> 00:07:36.875
His initial impression was to assume
that I wouldn't be able to do the work.

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.625
But of course, he was dead wrong

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.250
and quite apologetic in the end.

00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:46.791
It taught him a lesson
about making a snap judgment.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.791
