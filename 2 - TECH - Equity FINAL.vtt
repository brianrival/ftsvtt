00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:04.916
Bryan: Honestly, for me

00:00:04.916 --> 00:00:08.875
without assistive technology,
my life would be very isolated.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.458
I couldn't do my job.

00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:12.791
I wouldn't have an active personal life.

00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:16.833
I'd be in a dark place
without assistive technology to help me.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.250
[music plays]

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:26.166
Bryan: It's hard to describe in one word,

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:28.625
but it would have a huge impact on me,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.125
and all DeafBlind community members lives.

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:34.666
In our work lives for example,
the ability to zoom on the screen

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.250
or to use a screen reader means
we can read our emails.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.125
On a personal level,
I use it for lighting and cooking,

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.500
adjusting the lights
so that I can read books.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.000
There are countless ways
that I use technology at home.

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.375
Chris: At my previous job,

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:51.875
before I came to Helen Keller,

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:52.750
I was a teacher

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.625
and I worked at a school for the deaf.

00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:56.500
Without assistive technology,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.500
I would not have been able
to teach very well.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.583
While I possessed the necessary skills
in order to be a good teacher,

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:06.000
and while I had the capability
to be a good teacher,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
my vision and hearing loss
prevented me from doing so.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.041
However, assistive technology
allowed me to get through those obstacles.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:18.291
I also use some simple
low-tech devices as well.

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:22.416
For example, I was able to use tinted
plastic reading sheets.

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:25.125
I could clip the plastic
sheets on top of the paper,

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:26.375
flip it over,

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:29.875
and now I had the option of using blue,
pink, green, or yellow

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:32.000
as an overlay on the white paper.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.166
White paper gives off such a glare,
but with the colored overlays,

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:40.000
I could read it very easily.
I have a lot of those examples

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and each of them contributed
to my success as a teacher.

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:47.500
They created an equitable environment
where I was on par with the deaf

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.750
and hearing teachers who were teaching
deaf children at the school.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.750
What I'm getting at by telling that story

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.625
is that assistive technology

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:59.375
helps us achieve equity and levels
the playing field.

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:02.750
Scott: The large majority of
the things that I want to do

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.166
I can do through technology.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.791
And without technology,
there are a lot of things

00:02:07.791 --> 00:02:10.875
I cannot do as independently as I want.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.375
Even through social
media, things like Facebook,

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:15.125
apps like Nextdoor.

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:19.375
Nextdoor is an app
that allows you to connect to other people

00:02:19.375 --> 00:02:22.625
in your neighborhood.
And I'm able to use that

00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:25.625
and I get information about
what's going on in my neighborhood.

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:28.666
So again, it comes back to

00:02:28.666 --> 00:02:33.791
now I have equal access to the information,
equal access to communication,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.291
and I'm able to be
the person that I want to be.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.750
I don't have to sacrifice many things

00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:45.375
because I can’t have a phone conversation

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:48.750
or I can’t interact with somebody through text.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.666
I feel like I'm actually part
of the world I live in.

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:56.916
And that wasn't the case back in the late

00:02:56.916 --> 00:03:00.750
90s and early 2000s
when my hearing started dropping.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.500
And I was already completely blind.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.416
I felt very alone and very left out.

00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:07.250
So, technology,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.500
thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.750
I now feel like I'm more of a full person again.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.166
Chris: You mentioned Nextdoor,

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:16.416
and I'm laughing a little bit

00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:19.625
because I too use Nextdoor.

00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:20.875
I'm also the administrator

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:22.916
for one Nextdoor page.

00:03:22.916 --> 00:03:25.750
I doubt any of the members
know that I am DeafBlind,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.208
but who cares? We're too busy
sharing information on that page,

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:32.291
so it's just another
example of equitable access.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.125
[music plays]

00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:44.666
Chris: What has DeafBlind assistive technology
looked like through the decades

00:03:44.666 --> 00:03:48.250
in the fifties, sixties and seventies
and on through today?

00:03:48.833 --> 00:03:50.291
Scott, you're laughing.

00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:51.916
Do you want to answer that, please?

00:03:51.916 --> 00:03:57.125
Scott: There really wasn't a lot of things
available for people who are DeafBlind.

00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:59.666
Back in the fifties,
radio was a big thing.

00:03:59.666 --> 00:04:02.666
That's how everybody got their news,
turning on the radio.

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:06.916
Well, DeafBlind people didn't have that.
If you can't hear it,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.250
that's pretty worthless.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.625
Same with TV.

00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:14.625
If you're completely blind
and completely deaf,

00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:19.541
it's just a piece of junk as far as you're
concerned, because you can't see it,

00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:20.625
you can't hear it.

00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:22.625
So that's kind of where we came from.

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:26.125
Back in the fifties
and even into the sixties,

00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:30.166
there was really no reliable
way, even for DeafBlind people,

00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:34.000
to access the phone system,
which prior to the internet,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.291
that was a primary means
of communication.

00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:39.541
It was a very challenging time,
which is why I say

00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:43.875
it's great to be alive now, to
experience all this communication

00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:47.000
Bapin: Years ago when I was
first learning braille,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.375
I learned how to type

00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:51.125
using a manual typewriter back then,

00:04:51.125 --> 00:04:52.166
but I couldn't see

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:53.291
if I made a mistake,

00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:55.250
so I couldn't edit the letters.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.291
So I used to type
very carefully and slowly

00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:01.166
to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:03.250
If I did inadvertently make a mistake,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.416
I would tear the paper out
and start all over again.

00:05:06.416 --> 00:05:09.250
Then one year later, I was 13,

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:12.083
I finally got my first electric device

00:05:12.083 --> 00:05:14.166
that was called the Versabraille.

00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:19.000
It was similar to what blind people used
when they recorded on cassette tapes.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.291
They could use it
to listen to books on tape,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.375
But I would use the Versabraille
cassette tapes to store information.

00:05:26.375 --> 00:05:29.166
For example, I would take notes or

00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:32.666
write up a document.
I was really excited that I was able

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:35.875
to read it back and edit any mistakes.

00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:38.291
One negative was the weight.

00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:42.875
It weighed about 20 pounds
and it was awkward to carry around.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:46.750
The devices we use now
have become smaller and smaller.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.375
nothing is the 20 pounds of years
ago. Now our devices are

00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:54.250
as light as a pound or less

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.333
and that includes both my iPhone
and the braille display.

00:05:58.333 --> 00:05:59.916
So times have changed.

00:05:59.916 --> 00:06:03.000
Scott: I believe it was
in the sixties when teletype

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.166
or TTY

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:07.791
was implemented into the phone system.

00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:09.625
And what that meant was

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:12.166
they could have an interpreter

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:14.875
send digital beeps

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:18.125
but the random beeps
is what they sound like.

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:26.166
It's actually high-paced Morse Code,
but they can send that through the phone lines,

00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:29.750
And so deaf people, they were
able to communicate

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.791
back and forth with one another by typing.

00:06:32.791 --> 00:06:35.250
And they would have
very long conversations.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.541
I'm sure many of them, for the first time.

00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:41.291
I believe it was in the 70s or 80s...

00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:44.125
Yeah, probably in
the early to mid 80s

00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:48.875
when they finally came out with a device
that also included a small Braille display.

00:06:48.875 --> 00:06:51.291
So now for the first time,

00:06:51.291 --> 00:06:54.875
DeafBlind people were able to
also access the phone system.

00:06:54.875 --> 00:06:57.250
That really opened up a lot of doors.

00:06:58.125 --> 00:07:01.416
Chris: In the past, we had to make do
with what was available.

00:07:01.416 --> 00:07:06.416
Scott shared a little bit about that,
as well as Bapin and his experiences.

00:07:06.416 --> 00:07:11.166
Today we have a host of options
available to us, which is wonderful,

00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:15.166
and it's been wonderful to see
the evolution of assistive technology.

00:07:15.166 --> 00:07:18.000
