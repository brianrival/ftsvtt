00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Anne: You know, I work with people
who are DeafBlind too.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.750
And I do have a client who
the hospital basically called DCF

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.125
because they were like,
“how can a DeafBlind person

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:15.250
be a parent?”

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.000
Brian: It can definitely be tricky. A lot
of people don't understand how someone

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.166
who is blind or visually impaired or
DeafBlind can watch a child.

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.500
Anne: What am I going to do
when they hand this thing to me?

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500
How am I going to
take care of this baby?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.625
And you know,

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:33.500
and, how am I going
to figure out changing the diapers

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.250
and if the diaper is clean
and how am I going to figure out

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.375
measuring the bottles,
and all that stuff, you know.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.500
[music plays]

00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:54.500
Brian: Really it’s no different than someone
who’s typically sighted and hearing.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.250
We close off our living room

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.125
and make sure that any cords
and wires are tucked away.

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:05.125
But, you know, those are things
that any good parent would do,

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:09.375
regardless of disability
to make sure that your child's safe.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.250
Anne: I was always nervous to take
them outside in the backyard,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.000
because it’s not fenced in, and I was
nervous where the kids are.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And I can remember being like,
“where’s Jenny?” and she’s standing right here.

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:22.250
Like, literally right here next to me
and, you know, things like that,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.625
taking them outside was nerve-wracking.

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:27.375
But, you know,
there's all kinds of adaptations

00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:31.375
and there's all kinds of vibrating alerts
to tell you when the baby's crying

00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:35.250
or when a smoke detector
is going off, or the doorbell.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.000
And there's all kinds of services out there

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.125
and adaptive equipment
out there to help you.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.125
You know, I tried different things
like baby gates to keep them...

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:49.750
...at least I knew what room they were in.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.750
And also, I guess I’m just with my babies a lot.

00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:55.041
Brian: I used alternative techniques,

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:58.666
you know, when my daughter is running around

00:01:59.291 --> 00:02:03.083
I’m listening to her footsteps
to make sure that she is where she should be.

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:07.041
Right now, she is pretty loud in her movement,

00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:12.250
but, you know, if we had to, we could
put bells on her feet and track her that way.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.625
Anne: I slept with my hearing aids on

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:17.250
when they were real little
just because I was nervous.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.250
And then I slept with the monitor
right next to my head.

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:24.666
I used way more baby wipes
than anyone should ever use, probably,

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:27.291
to make sure that my daughter was clean.

00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:29.291
Brian: You use your sense of touch.

00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:32.666
You know, I change diapers and things
and make sure that they're clean and

00:02:33.416 --> 00:02:34.666
everything’s good to go.

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:37.541
It's really just all about
using different techniques.

00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:41.541
And at the end of the day,
it really doesn't matter

00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:43.416
whether or not you have a disability.

00:02:43.416 --> 00:02:46.416
Anne: Have I banged into toddlers
and my kids? Yes.

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:48.958
You know, they bounce.

00:02:48.958 --> 00:02:52.291
Have I made mistakes? Yes.

00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:55.166
But it’s kind of...

00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:56.791
...one day at a time.

00:02:56.791 --> 00:03:00.041
I don't want to say it wasn't a big deal
because it is a big deal.

00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:04.833
But I just basically
figure it out as I go along.

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:06.541
[music plays]

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:14.750
Brian: My daughter loves to,
even if she’s reading in print,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.375
use her finger
to kind of navigate the words.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.416
She also loves
holding the guide dog leash.

00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:24.000
Her and Intrigue are really close.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And I think, you know, I could see her
one day being an orientation and mobility

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.375
specialist for people who are blind,
visually impaired, and DeafBlind.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.916
I think they'll have a greater
awareness and compassion

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:41.375
for people with disabilities
and people without disabilities.

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:44.125
They'll be much more well-rounded

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:49.125
as individuals and be a lot more
compassionate towards others.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.750
Anne: My kids became helpful very young.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.500
You know, I think even when
they were in kindergarten

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.875
they would grab my hand and say,
“okay, mommy, there's a step” you know, or,

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:06.625
“okay, mommy, the chair is right there”
or, “watch out for the wet floor sign.”

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:09.125
Or, you know, things like that.

00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:13.125
They're going to be amazing adults
because they've grown up

00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:16.750
helping me and they've grown up

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.375
being understanding of people
with different disabilities.

00:04:21.541 --> 00:04:26.500
Francis: As of right now, the voice you hear
is my daughter, Grace.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.625
She always interprets for me
when we go to restaurants, movie theaters,

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:31.750
she's always with me.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.250
She'll sit next to me and interpret for me
just like my daughter Naomi.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.250
She'll always interpret for me,
whether it's voice or just through sign language.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.500
Growing up, I struggled
when they were kids.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.500
I tried to teach them to do this,
but they didn't really know.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.000
And they didn't get used to
until about eight or nine.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And then they started to get used
to guiding me and helping and knowing

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.625
to interpret and kind of
just becoming one unit.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.500
Grace: I feel like

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.250
my sister and I and a lot of kids
who have deaf parents or who have deaf

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.375
and blind parents or parents
who have some form of disability,

00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:11.625
I think you grow up with
just this empathy for people.

00:05:11.625 --> 00:05:15.000
You feel for them because
you see your parents struggling

00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:19.750
in a world that you may not struggle in
and you want it to be equal and fair.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.000
So you now encounter strangers
and you just have this empathy of like,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.750
I'm sure life is very hard for you
because of blank.

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:29.750
I want to do what I can
to help you or to help

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.750
have clear communication, or
if you need something, I want to be there.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.500
So I think that's been one big thing.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.375
Believe it or not

00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:39.375
Brian: DeafBlind and blind and deaf
parents aren’t a new concept.

00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:44.125
You know, I have mentors in my life
who are in their sixties

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.875
with grandkids and raising children
and raising grandkids all on their own.

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:50.750
And so,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.375
yeah, it's really interesting

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:56.750
how the public perception
hasn't changed too much.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:57.875
[music plays]

00:05:57.875 --> 00:05:59.375
Grace: That's a question you always get,

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:00.875
“How did your parents raise you?”

00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:02.875
Like, “how did you learn how to speak

00:06:02.875 --> 00:06:03.916
If your parents are deaf?”

00:06:03.916 --> 00:06:06.500
People don't realize
that they can do stuff.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.500
We don't want people
to view them that way.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.750
And the change that we want to see and how
we want to go out and impact people

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.125
so that way our parents moving forward
and people like them

00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:18.750
don't have to encounter
something like that.

00:06:19.625 --> 00:06:22.250
Anne: Maybe we have to prove
ourselves a little bit more

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
to show, to demonstrate

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.500
that we are capable
and that people who are DeafBlind,

00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:33.625
for the most part,

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:36.500
can do what hearing and sighted people do.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.916
They just need to do it differently.

00:06:38.916 --> 00:06:42.250
And it might be a little bit harder,
it might take a little bit longer.

00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:47.875
We might have to use some equipment
or some devices to help us, but

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:49.625
we can do it, you know.

00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:52.500
