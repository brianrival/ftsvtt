00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.208
Nathalie: Hi, my name is Nathalie Reyes.

00:00:05.208 --> 00:00:07.500
Adriana: My name is Adriana Reali.

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:09.208
Scott: This is Scott Davert.

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:11.291
Chris: And I'm Chris Woodfill.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.750
[music plays]

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.041
Chris: I’ll start by explaining the  communication
access that we have here today.

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:28.291
I'm a visual sign language user,
and I'm using a visual sign language

00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.750
interpreter to access communication.

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:35.000
We have Adriana, who uses a tactile
sign language interpreter,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.875
who will interpret everything
being said and signed.

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:42.666
And Adriana will receive
all of that information tactilely.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.791
Nathalie and Scott have microphones
as part of an FM system.

00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:51.125
The FM system is connected to a Bluetooth,
which can transmit

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:54.375
the auditory information
directly into their hearing aids.

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:59.375
We also have voice interpreters
interpreting what Adriana and I are signing.

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:04.791
We are fully inclusive and we have full
communication access for this roundtable.

00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:08.000
[music plays]

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:16.625
Scott: I certainly prefer getting content
through my hearing aids and the method

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:20.416
that you already talked about.
And that works well for me.

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:25.416
Now, there are other environments
where using the microphone,

00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:29.041
the FM system is not necessarily
the best option for me.

00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:32.625
There are certain situations
where it's so loud that

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.041
I can't hear anything really
or make much sense of it.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:41.166
And this is because my hearing aids
amplify everything.

00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:43.750
So that includes background noise.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.958
They don't have a hearing aids
that read your mind yet, unfortunately.

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:52.666
So in louder environments,
I have a variety of different things I use.

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:55.166
I use something called the Rochester
method.

00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:58.375
And the Rochester method is essentially

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:01.250
the ability to

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.166
have hand shapes, form letters
into the hand of the other person.

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:08.833
So, for example,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.500
I'm using my left hand
and showing the letter ‘S,’

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.041
which is a closed fist
with the thumb on the outside.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.291
So that's a non-auditory way

00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:21.916
in which I sometimes access communication.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.625
Chris: You highlight how varied
our communication preferences

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:28.166
can be depending
on the setting and situation.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.541
There is no one way to communicate

00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:32.833
and you demonstrate that clearly.

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:34.500
Moving on to Nathalie.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.125
Nathalie: Yes, so my form
of communication is verbal.

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:46.291
I prefer speaking with people in quiet places.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:51.250
As Scott described,
technology has improved,

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:55.125
but when it comes to loud environments

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:59.041
like a restaurant or a concert, a bar...

00:02:59.041 --> 00:03:02.125
it can be a tricky situation

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.250
A communication
I use is American Sign Language

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:11.750
and it's been very helpful

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:16.375
in communicating
expecially in a loud environment.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
That way I have more access to know
what's going on.

00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:23.791
But again,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.125
I rely more verbally

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.250
so I enjoy talking with people

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.250
and it is very important
that because I wear hearing aids

00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:41.500
it doesn’t mean I cannot hear
or communicate with people.

00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:45.250
Chris: Thank you again, Nathalie,
for describing the variety

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.250
of communication approaches
you have in various settings.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.875
Let's move next to Adriana.

00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:53.166
Adriana: Recently, I have become

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.666
almost completely blind,
which I have accepted,

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:56.541
almost completely blind,
which I have accepted.

00:03:56.875 --> 00:04:02.125
And that is the reason I am a fully
tactile user and a haptics user.

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:05.666
A perfect example
is that I can't see here today

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:09.250
and that's the reason why my interpreter
is sitting next to me,

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.625
giving me environmental information so
I can understand the layout of the space.

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:17.750
She lets me know who's talking or signing.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.916
She also is providing haptics on my back,
giving me information

00:04:21.916 --> 00:04:24.666
like the other participants’
facial expression.

00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:27.500
She might identify that someone is moving

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.458
or when we're interpreting switching,

00:04:29.458 --> 00:04:32.750
or when the food or drinks
have arrived, effortlessly.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.375
Now, when I'm in public or encounter
people in the world that don't know

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:41.791
sign language, I typically use
a notes app with my iPhone.

00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:44.541
So I can communicate through texts.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.000
I use a Braille display and we're able
to have an exchange that way.

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:52.875
Sometimes I don't have technology
or my equipment with me,

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:55.250
I have to use communication cards,

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.916
so that people can read
what is on the cards.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.875
Then they can respond
using POP or ‘print on palm.’

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And that's how I communicate in public.

00:05:06.416 --> 00:05:09.250
Chris: I'll take a minute
to describe print on palm.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.666
You need to use all uppercase letters

00:05:11.666 --> 00:05:14.500
and you print the letters out one by one

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.291
on the palm of the person's hand.

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:25.000
So if I were spelling out ‘Chris,’
I would spell C-H-R-I-S.

00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:28.875
Adriana: Each of our communication
preferences are different.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.666
Look at Nathalie, Scott, Chris, and me.

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:36.000
Some of us are deaf
and some are hard of hearing.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.583
It's not easy.

00:05:37.916 --> 00:05:39.916
Chris: The pattern you'll notice so far

00:05:39.916 --> 00:05:43.250
is that no one uses
only one way to communicate.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.416
Their communication preferences
and approaches are dependent

00:05:46.416 --> 00:05:48.625
on the different situations they are in.

00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:53.000
Scott, I'm wondering what your options are
for communicating with someone

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.375
if you don't have
any technology available.

00:05:55.375 --> 00:05:56.666
What are your options?

00:05:56.666 --> 00:06:00.541
How do you communicate with people
in the absence of technology?

00:06:02.375 --> 00:06:06.375
Ah, switch interpreters first.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.666
Scott: I always wear my hearing aids unless I want
to quickly end an argument or something.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:19.041
Then I turn them off and I don't hear
anything, so I win no matter what.

00:06:19.416 --> 00:06:21.666
To be serious, though,

00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:25.416
some of it really just
depends on the situation

00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:28.916
and also the state of my hearing that day.

00:06:29.375 --> 00:06:34.125
Sometimes I will take an SSPs with me.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.500
SSP is a ‘Support Service Provider’

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.375
and they help provide environmental

00:06:41.375 --> 00:06:44.541
information to the DeafBlind individual.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.500
as well as helping
you know how to navigate.

00:06:50.041 --> 00:06:52.875
I tend to use SSPs

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.750
as a more reliable thing because,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.875
as everyone knows, technology is great

00:06:59.875 --> 00:07:01.791
when it works, but it doesn't always,

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:04.916
the same way print on palm
doesn't always work for everybody.

00:07:05.416 --> 00:07:09.625
So in those type of situation,
if I don't have access to any technology,

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.125
I hope I have someone around me

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:17.125
who I can turn to, to work with me
and provide some communication support.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.750
I don’t have one method that is 100% reliable

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.791
and that's why I, like the rest of you,
have so many different ways

00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:32.000
of communicating because
plans A and B might both fail.

00:07:32.416 --> 00:07:35.375
You have to have a plan C, you know,

00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:41.125
especially when it comes to situations
where the technology isn't available.

00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:44.500
Chris: This has been a great discussion.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.625
How we communicate has been different.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.666
I hope our discussion
has helped the larger audience

00:07:49.666 --> 00:07:52.625
understand the ways
in which we communicate

00:07:52.625 --> 00:07:53.666
and that they now have

00:07:53.666 --> 00:07:57.500
a greater understanding
of the diversity of our communication.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.500
Thank you to all of you
for participating in this roundtable.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.666
Thank you so much.

00:08:10.375 --> 00:08:15.375
