00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:04.250
Rebecca: People will come into my office

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.375
and say, “well, you know, I just googled
you and I want to be honest...

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.916
and now I feel like I can't believe
I've been coming in here

00:00:09.916 --> 00:00:12.125
and bitching about all the things
that I'm talking about,

00:00:12.125 --> 00:00:14.625
knowing that you're going deaf and blind.”

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:16.125
So then we have to process that.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.625
I have to say to them,
“What does that mean that I'm going

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:22.500
deaf and blind and that you
don't have DeafBlindness?

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:25.416
Does it mean that I'm worse off than you are?”

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:28.041
First and foremost, I'm a psychotherapist.

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:32.000
That's my job but it's something that
I really love, I'm passionate about,

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.875
and I also have a disability.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:37.583
As opposed to, “I'm a woman with a disability

00:00:37.583 --> 00:00:40.583
who is a psychotherapist.”

00:00:40.583 --> 00:00:44.291
[music plays]

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.958
I was raised in a very
community oriented family.

00:00:54.125 --> 00:01:00.041
My grandmother was one of the first
educators in the civil rights movement.

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:03.000
She did so much with

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:06.500
trying to help people
who were disadvantaged.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:10.250
Growing up in a family who were very,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.875
very focused on being an
active part of the community,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.250
that really influenced my ability
to be able to go out in the world

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.000
and maybe stick out like
a sore thumb at times.

00:01:28.625 --> 00:01:30.916
Mental health is so stigmatized,

00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:34.666
even more so than disability in many ways.

00:01:35.416 --> 00:01:38.541
For so many reasons,
whether it's societal,

00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:41.166
whether it's cultural,
whether it's religious reasons,

00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:44.916
that it is unacceptable to struggle.

00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:49.791
When we have mental health issues,
we oftentimes fight ourselves.

00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:52.250
We have this tremendous internal battle.

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:58.500
With trying to make ourselves think
right or to if I was just strong enough,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.541
if I just had more willpower.
All of these different reasons

00:02:02.541 --> 00:02:07.916
or excuses that we make
for not being able to do something

00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:14.416
and we don't allow ourselves to sit with,
what if I have mental illness?

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:17.875
(music plays)

00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:23.916
So when you work with someone
who is low vision or DeafBlind,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.000
and let's say your office is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.375
a beautiful office filled with windows

00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:33.666
and that you sit in a chair
with windows behind you,

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:37.375
and the person that you're meeting with,
your client, is sitting in a

00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:39.250
on a couch across from you.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.750
They won't be able to potentially
see your face.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.375
Your face will be shadowed
because of their vision.

00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:46.666
So even being able
to create an environment,

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:48.875
set up an environment
where they can comfortably

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:51.125
be able to see you with the vision
that they still have

00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:55.125
so that that person is not having to adapt
to whatever your space is

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:57.875
that's based on a sighted person's,

00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:00.875
you know, comfort or world.

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:05.125
Anything from whether it's someone
navigating and having to find your office.

00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:12.000
You know, if you give someone an address
like my office is at 555 5th Avenue.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.125
Okay, well, it would be more helpful:

00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:16.916
my office is at 555 5th Avenue.

00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:19.541
You can take the 6 train to 51st Street.

00:03:19.541 --> 00:03:21.250
When you walk into the door,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.250
there will be a doorman's station to your right.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.625
Like those specifics to provide
context and guidelines

00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:35.500
for them to be able to access your elevator
or the stairs to your building.

00:03:35.958 --> 00:03:39.166
If you need to grab someone's arm
to help them find the seat.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.125
There are a lot of things
that maybe traditionally

00:03:42.125 --> 00:03:45.125
would not be comfortable
or appropriate in a hearing sighted

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:50.291
therapeutic setting
that you may have to completely bypass

00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:54.750
when you're working with someone
who has vision or hearing loss or both.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.750
I address it right away
because it's something that's important

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.875
for us to talk about and to continue
to process in our therapeutic process.

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:08.583
[music plays]

00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:16.875
Some of the core issues that I really
had to face and deal with are grief and loss.

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:19.541
And I think as I've gone
through transitions

00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:22.625
throughout my own process of losing
both my vision and my hearing

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:26.416
is needing to grieve and mourn and be able

00:04:26.416 --> 00:04:29.250
to just have someone there with me.

00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:34.000
Not to try to make me feel better, but
just to be present and to validate that.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.625
And I think oftentimes when we
think about therapists and therapy

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:41.000
and all of these different modalities
we use, first and foremost,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.291
someone just needs to know
that you're validating how they feel.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.750
Because how we feel is not
something that we can control.

00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:50.125
We can control how we respond.

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:53.125
We can be mindful
about not being as impulsive

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:56.375
or compulsive, but you
can't control how you feel.

00:04:56.916 --> 00:05:00.625
And when you have a disability,
there's so much anger that you feel

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.375
towards yourself because of your own
internalized ableism towards other people

00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:08.750
who maybe weren't able to meet
your needs or recognize your needs.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.791
How society doesn't accommodate you,
how society and the world is not accessible.

00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:17.166
And so this anger,
I think, can build and develop

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:19.875
and just percolate inside of people.

00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:23.791
And I think that as someone
with a disability,

00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:29.500
it’s something that's so important
to be able to develop again a relationship with,

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.625
to allow yourself to feel, to allow
yourself to express, to communicate,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.291
to get out.

00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:40.625
Because when you live in that anger,
it means that you're operating

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:45.125
and engaging with the world
from a place of resentment.

00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:49.250
What I found is that when
you don't speak your needs,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.625
when you don't communicate
how this could be an easier

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:57.291
conversation for you, it means
that we're both struggling.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.041
I'm struggling to be able to get
the information to you

00:06:00.041 --> 00:06:02.875
and you're struggling to receive
the information from me.

00:06:03.375 --> 00:06:06.125
Oftentimes, it's just being
able to teach people

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.750
from an advocacy standpoint
as their therapist.

00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:14.875
And another part of it is when
someone share something with me

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:21.125
because I've experienced it firsthand,
I often find that people who have vision loss

00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:23.625
for instance, will say,

00:06:23.625 --> 00:06:26.750
“I've never had anybody give me
feedback like that before.”

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:32.000
Or, “I've never had anyone
describe what I'm feeling so aptly.”

00:06:32.291 --> 00:06:36.000
And so I think that there is
this understanding based on experience.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.375
I think the best therapists are the ones
who have been through things themselves.

00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:43.625
And so I think there is this
feeling of being,

00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:49.291
no pun intended, seen or being heard
in a way that they never have before

00:06:49.291 --> 00:06:52.375
with someone who doesn't
live with the same challenges.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.333
