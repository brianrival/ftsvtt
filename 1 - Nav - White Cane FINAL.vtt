00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.875
Fatou: When you first start using it,
it feels uncomfortable.

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:09.750
I know that people will lose their s**t
when they see you using your cane

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.500
and you can still see them
and they're just staring at you.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.875
I know it throws them off,

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:15.750
but I'm like, “Look, you better
look out because you're going

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.125
to run your head into something
and crack your head open”.

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:20.291
That's why I use my cane.

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:21.500

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:34.375
Greg: So the first time that I saw a cane,
I saw a person using it

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:38.375
and just kind of walking by me
and I was like, “I wonder what that is”.

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:40.750
I noticed that they had
something in their hands,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.875
but I wasn't sure exactly what it was.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.875
And my family had to actually give me

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:46.750
the explanation that
the person couldn't see,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.375
and it was something
that they used to help them.

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:52.500
What does it mean if somebody
is using a cane like this?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So Gene, my instructor
at the time actually said,

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:58.416
“Well, it's for safety when somebody travels.

00:00:58.416 --> 00:00:59.375
So you want to make sure

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:02.375
that you're protecting yourself
and not bumping into obstacles.”

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:05.875
I wonder if that's something
that I should use.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But at the same time,
I wasn't sure if I was ready to use it

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.250
because I felt embarrassed having to use
something that looked like that.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.500
Rebecca: When you have a disability that,
to a large extent you can

00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:19.916
either hide or that you can't see
just from looking at someone,

00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:23.125
someone I don't think would look at me
and say, oh, she's DeafBlind.

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:24.875
Or, she’s going deaf and blind.

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:29.000
And so having to make that decision
of putting myself out in the world

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:33.875
openly as a person with a disability,
that's a coming out process.

00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:36.250
I remember hating using my cane.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.750
I used to sometimes use umbrellas
and sort of navigate my way,

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:43.000
because I just wasn't ready
to put myself out there.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.250
And the first, you know,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.000
I don't know, five, six, seven,
eight times I used my cane in public

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.750
I cried because there
was a mourning process.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.250
There is that grieving process
of no longer being seen

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.875
as a fully sighted person,
as someone without a disability.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.500
Fatou: You do not have to ever
feel embarrassed because of your cane.

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:06.250
People will never understand
why a DeafBlind person needs to use their cane

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.375
when they have some vision.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
The first time I started using my cane,
it was awkward.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.750
It felt weird having people staring at me.

00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:16.875
And I mean, I don't know, I find it funny.

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:19.500
And then eventually
I built more confidence

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.750
and I didn't pay no mind to the people
that were watching me

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.125
because it's about you and your safety.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.875
[music plays]

00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:35.000
James: So this is my mobility cane.

00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:37.250
I have a carabiner that I can attach

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.875
to my belt loop so that
my hands are free to sign.

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:43.625
And when I try and figure out my cane
amongst others of my friends,

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:47.000
I have these beads on here
that identify this as mine.

00:02:47.375 --> 00:02:49.625
Noticing that I also have this big roller.

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:53.125
Lydia: The white cane can serve
a lot of purposes.

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:59.125
Of course, the primary one is ensuring
that I don't bump into obstacles

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:02.375
in front of me, but after

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.875
having a lot of experience with it,
if you're a seasoned user,

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:09.500
you can get a lot of
other information from it,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.750
such as the type of terrain
you're walking on.

00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:15.625
You can

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:19.000
feel where you are in space
and give you clues about

00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:20.875
where you need to go.

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:22.375
Rebecca: My worst vision is below me.

00:03:22.375 --> 00:03:25.625
So using that cane can be very helpful
so that I don't have to be looking

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:27.125
down and up and down and up.

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:28.875
It gives me that information.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:32.500
But when it's dark out, and particularly
when it's dark out in an area

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.625
that I'm not familiar with,
where I don't know

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:37.875
there's a crack in the street here
or a pothole here or whatever,

00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:42.500
I find myself relying so much more heavily
on the very tip of my cane.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.625
And in those moments of being able

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:49.375
to use my cane and rely
on the tip of my cane on that touch

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.875
and recognizing that it was connecting
directly to a part of my brain

00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:57.625
that I was developing a muscle
that I was learning to exercise.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.375
I started to feel so much more trust

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.500
in using my cane and confidence,
and that was something

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.250
that was so cool that I felt
this need to share it with the world.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.125
Like, how cool is this?

00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:14.625
You know, that we have all of these parts

00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:17.250
of our brain, of our bodies
that we just don't use,

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:22.000
likely because we have other senses
or abilities to make up for it.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.125
But that when you do lose
these senses or abilities,

00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:30.500
that your body has an incredible
way of compensating.

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:32.500
[music plays]

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.125
Greg: Initially, it was terrible.

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:43.125
I mean, at night
I would bump into everything and everybody

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:44.500
and people would get mad at me.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.625
And I'm like, you know,
I just couldn't see them.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.750
But now having the cane,

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.750
I was able to identify things
or people that were in my way

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.750
and they could see the cane
which made them get out of my way.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.375
It's like parting the Red Sea.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.750
Everybody gets out of my way as I'm
walking down the street with my cane.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.750
James: I'm not only deaf,
but I'm also DeafBlind.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.750
So it's difficult on the train
because sometimes there’s steps.

00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:10.291
So it takes me a bit to get up those steps
and people are always rushing to get on

00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:13.375
and sometimes people get pissed,
you know, like, “come on!”

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:15.750
And I'm like, “I didn't see you.”

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.875
You know, people don't know
where I can and cannot see.

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:20.750
So that's sometimes problematic.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.250
And if I have my cane, you know,
that helps me because people

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.000
kind of, they part the way
so that I can get through.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.666
They see that they have to go around me.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.625
Greg: Practicing at home,

00:05:31.625 --> 00:05:34.750
over time, I would be able
to go to the store at night.

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:38.000
You know my girlfriend was like,
“Oh, I need to go to the store.”

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.750
I'm like, “oh, I can do it.”

00:05:39.875 --> 00:05:44.000
And sure enough, with my cane,
I was able to go out and do it on my own,

00:05:44.375 --> 00:05:47.125
again because people
sort of got out of my way.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.375
So it's so much better
now than when it was, you know,

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:54.250
me knocking into people, knocking them down,
me knocking myself down.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.500
And I didn't have to be embarrassed.

00:05:57.541 --> 00:05:58.541
And it's great.

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:02.125
James: My cane helps me
a tremendous amount.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.625
I feel like I’m equal now.
