[music plays]

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.750
Francis: And God made us in His creation.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.250
We are His children
and He cares for each one of us.

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:19.166
We need to believe that is faith.

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:23.750
Faith means believing without seeing.

00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:34.541
Hello, my name is Dr. Francis Casale.

00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:42.750
I am a pastor to a deaf
and deaf and blind ASL congregation.

00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:45.375
It wasn't until I was about two,

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:50.750
I was playing and my mother was calling
my name and I didn't respond.

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:52.875
And my mom was quite confused.

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:56.125
And so she went ahead
and took me to see the doctor.

00:00:56.125 --> 00:00:59.125
The doctor found that I was actually deaf

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.541
and my mother was very heartbroken.
She didn't know what to do.

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:03.500
The doctor said, Oh,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.000
“you can just teach him how to speak
and he can learn oral.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.500
It's okay, it's fine.”

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.541
And I had a therapist who would help me speak

00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:15.500
and the teacher said,
”Frances is not going to succeed.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.750
He's going to fail because he's not
really good at reading lips or speaking.”

00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:23.875
And my mom was just heartbroken
and she cried.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:31.625
And it wasn’t until my mom went to ASD
for a parent-teacher association.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:34.250
They had a meeting
and my mother was helping

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.250
and she saw a lot of deaf parents
and they were signing

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.375
and they all had houses,
they had cars, they had boats.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.250
They were living
just the regular normal life.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.291
And my mom realized that deaf people
can do more than just read people's lips.

00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:52.666
TV Host: I would like to introduce to you

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:55.666
Reverend Francis Casale

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:59.375
Could you share with us your testimonies

00:01:59.375 --> 00:02:04.416
as to how you came to know the Lord
and how the Lord led you to the ministry?

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:07.541
Francis: I would like to share with you
about one of the things that God

00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:10.666
has changed my life
for these many years.

00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:14.000
I’ve been raised

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
in a very good background
with a Catholic family,

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:19.250
very strong Catholic family.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.541
Francis: I was Catholic
for very many years,

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:25.750
and it wasn't until I got
into Gallaudet University

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.625
when I kind of just pushed it away.

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:30.666
I said, “they're all liars and false prophets.”

00:02:30.666 --> 00:02:33.000
And I was like,
“I'm going to become an atheist.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.625
I'm not going to believe
in anything at all.

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:36.875
I'm going to have no religion.

00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:41.291
I only focus on me
and my art, art is my religion.

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:43.166
I'm going to just focus on that.”

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:44.625
Francis: I just didn't believe anything,

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.000
just for the fun of things myself

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.250
and fooled around with
drinking, drugs, and etc.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.208
had all this fooling around
just for the kicks.

00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:56.125
Francis: I went to Gallaudet University.

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:57.791
My major was art.

00:02:57.791 --> 00:02:59.125
It was for five years.

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:02.541
So I did art and then I also did drama.

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:06.916
After that, I became
kind of my own business.

00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:13.125
So I did photography for weddings and
I would sell paintings to different places

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:18.375
and that is kind of what
I had been doing until my eyesight

00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:23.666
started to become less and less.
I was at the age of sixteen.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.833
I was learning how to drive and
I would be kind of, you know, swerving.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:31.500
And then my teacher said, “Hey,
I think you have an eyesight problem.”

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.750
I was like, “okay, I'm
going to go to the eye doctor.”

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.541
And I found that I had
what is called Usher syndrome.

00:03:38.875 --> 00:03:42.625
At the time I could look forward
and it would be clear,

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:48.000
but I couldn't see peripheral vision.
So I was very limited with my vision.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.750
And so what I had to do is
I kind of had to stop the art.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.416
I wasn't able to read as much.

00:03:53.416 --> 00:03:55.875
I kind of felt isolated and lonely.

00:03:55.875 --> 00:04:00.625
And to be honest with you, I couldn't
accept myself as a deaf and blind.

00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:04.750
Francis: Until I met a person
who was a deaf pastor

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.666
and he shared the word with me.

00:04:07.666 --> 00:04:10.750
And I tried to counterattack and

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.875
every time he'd speak to me
I'd come back with something else.

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:16.500
But I began to see more and more.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.041
I began to understand

00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:19.791
God's love through this person.

00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:21.750
Francis: He was teaching me
about the Bible.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.625
And so I said, “okay, I'll read it.”

00:04:24.625 --> 00:04:29.625
So I opened it up and I just
I fell in love with it.

00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:35.666
I was just like, “wow, there's just so much
and just explaining how Jesus healed,

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:37.916
how he worked
with all different types of people

00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:41.625
and how much he showed his love,
God's love for people.”

00:04:41.666 --> 00:04:45.375
And I decided to,

00:04:46.291 --> 00:04:48.750
you know, accept Jesus Christ in my life.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.750
[music plays]

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.875
And so we were kind of doing

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:08.041
like a pastors’ retreat in the mountains.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.166
And I was singing,
I was thinking, I was praying.

00:05:12.166 --> 00:05:16.250
I said, you know, ”God, if you're going
to heal me, I'm here, I'm alone.

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:19.375
Nobody's around. Like, please heal me.

00:05:19.375 --> 00:05:20.250
I'm ready.”

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.541
You know, I'm going to pray.
I cried.

00:05:22.541 --> 00:05:27.125
I looked and read into the Bible
and I read John chapter nine,

00:05:27.541 --> 00:05:31.000
and it said, Jesus Christ walked to the temple

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.458
and his disciples looked on and they saw
a lot of crippled people, a lot of blind people,

00:05:36.458 --> 00:05:39.500
a lot of deaf people
that were begging on the side of the road.

00:05:39.916 --> 00:05:43.500
And they said, “Hey, there's
a blindman there

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.125
He's blind because he sinned?

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.541
Jesus answered, ”No, no, that is not true.

00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:52.750
Regardless of what happened,
God makes these decisions.”

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:55.875
And that when I read that
hit me very hard.

00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:59.666
And I just thought,
“okay, God makes these decisions.

00:05:59.666 --> 00:06:02.291
He has a plan for my life.”

00:06:02.291 --> 00:06:05.500
And I just cried and cried and cried.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.625
And I told God,
“please forgive me for having this

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:12.375
want of my own plan,
my own way, my own desire,

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:16.291
my pride to say, I want to be healed.
I want to see.”

00:06:16.291 --> 00:06:19.291
I just let go. And
I truly accepted myself.

00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:24.625
And I thought, “okay, praise God, I am
a deaf and blind person and that's okay.

00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:26.666
And I'm happy with who I am.

00:06:26.666 --> 00:06:27.750
And I can teach.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.750
I can still tell stories and act and teach
people God's word and share.”

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.875
And I've been able to help deaf
and blind people

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:39.791
and to show that you can do it,
they can do it.

00:06:41.916 --> 00:06:45.125
And then after that,
we went to Japan, my wife and I.

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:48.500
Francis: In Japan I saw more and more
of God's work through me.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.125
So I decided to rededicate and fully,
fully submit myself to Him.

00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:56.791
Francis: We set up two churches

00:06:56.791 --> 00:07:00.750
for the deaf in Japan,
and we came back to America.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.000
And I started a church called

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.791
Inner Community Church of God.

00:07:09.625 --> 00:07:13.000
[TV program music plays]

00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:19.000
Francis: Oh, hi there.

00:07:19.375 --> 00:07:22.375
Let me put this down. Hello. Hello.

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:23.875
I'm very excited right now.

00:07:23.875 --> 00:07:26.875
I'm preparing to be ready
for a special event.

00:07:26.875 --> 00:07:31.625
Francis: There was a calling that led me now
to be part of a TV program.

00:07:31.625 --> 00:07:36.916
I was acting as a chef Italian cook,
and he would tell some Bible stories.

00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:41.125
Francis: A man who was paralyzed and lying on a mat
was carried to the house by his friends.

00:07:41.125 --> 00:07:44.250
When Jesus saw this,
he was impressed and said to the man,

00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:46.541
“Your sins have been forgiven.”

00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:48.750
Francis: They didn't know that, at the time,

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:49.625
I was deaf and blind.

00:07:49.625 --> 00:07:52.250
They just thought,
Wow, he's just this deaf guy.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:53.291
He's a great signer.

00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:56.750
Until they met me
and they said, wow, you're deaf and blind.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.000
You could act.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:58.875
What?

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.250
Francis: Thank you for your time. Please stay with us
as we have a wedding blessing.

00:08:05.375 --> 00:08:08.750
Specifically for the DeafBlind
who will be getting married.

00:08:09.541 --> 00:08:15.416
This very unique situation, me as a
DeafBlind pastor and our couple who are DeafBlind.

00:08:16.666 --> 00:08:19.666
The two will become
one and start a new life

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:24.500
with new experiences and new relationships.

00:08:24.916 --> 00:08:28.250
So the old is passed away
and a new life is beginning

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:33.625
through their love. And love
melts away all problems.

00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:38.000
Frank, do you take Kathie
as your wife today

00:08:38.166 --> 00:08:43.041
and this day forward till death
do you part and Jesus’ name and faith?

00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:46.000
Kathie: I can't believe
that I'm married by Pastor Francis.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.166
I just can't believe it.

00:08:47.166 --> 00:08:49.000
I feel more inspired.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So happy, just elated.

00:08:53.875 --> 00:08:54.916
Francis: It is amazing

00:08:54.916 --> 00:08:58.791
as a DeafBlind pastor
alongside a DeafBlind couple,

00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:05.125
The three of us truly felt like
we were in our own world, united together.

00:09:06.291 --> 00:09:07.416
Francis: As a pastor,

00:09:07.416 --> 00:09:11.625
I guide them to encourage, support,
love, and cherish each other

00:09:11.625 --> 00:09:13.500
for the glory of God.
Thank you.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:20.000
A lot of misconceptions is the idea that deaf
and blind people can't do anything.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.375
Oh, you're deaf and blind.

00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:23.250
Oh, I feel so sorry for you.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.250
But I don't want to be burdened by myself.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.875
Someone else please help them.

00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:30.250
But you have to teach people
to understand.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.791
Deaf and blind people can get married,
they can become counselors,

00:09:33.791 --> 00:09:37.375
they can do so many things.
And I just would encourage them.

00:09:39.291 --> 00:09:43.041
