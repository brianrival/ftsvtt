00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.500
Rosanna: When I was in public school,
there were really

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.125
no other people with disabilities
other than myself and one other girl.

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:17.875
The tools that we had to use

00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:20.000
were what we would call today primitive.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.666
[music plays]

00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:31.500
Rosanna: Well, I'd say there's a big change

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.125
from when I was in elementary school
up until now for sure

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:40.750
because that was before
the ADA even existed.

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:44.416
After the ADA came into existence,

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:48.750
there definitely was more of an

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.250
understanding of advocacy.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.333
The one area that I have seen a change

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:59.666
and that really has been marketed in

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.500
my lifetime is in the area of technology.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.750
There is so much more
that is available now

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to a DeafBlind individual
because of the growth in technology.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.666
So the kids coming up
today have tons more access

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:22.625
to educational materials in order

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:26.875
for them to achieve their goals,
their educational goals.

00:01:27.125 --> 00:01:29.375
Rocky: A lot is becoming digital.

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:32.625
In fact, more and more
is becoming paperless.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:35.875
And that's actually a good thing
for the DeafBlind community.

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:37.625
For example, I'm totally blind.

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:42.041
I have no vision and so
I can't read standard print at all.

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:45.416
While I do have the ability to scan

00:01:45.416 --> 00:01:50.750
things using OCR, you know optical character
recognition technology,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.291
or even from time to time
I might ask or hire an actual reader.

00:01:56.875 --> 00:02:00.375
The need for that is extraordinarily rare.

00:02:00.375 --> 00:02:02.625
You can get just about anything
electronically.

00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:06.875
Lydia: Within my lifetime
I definitely know that as a young child

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:10.625
and even into some
of my early teenage years,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.125
there wasn't quite as much advocacy

00:02:14.125 --> 00:02:17.375
because change,
as it still is to this day,

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:19.625
was still very much in progress.

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:24.625
But I've definitely noticed over the past,
definitely in the last five years,

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:28.625
a pretty significant
push for more inclusivity.

00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:34.666
And along with that comes more advocacy
by persons with disabilities.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.500
I think with the push for inclusivity,
people have been more inclined to speak up

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.166
for themselves
and for their needs and

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:46.250
while change is being made,

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:49.625
speaking up as to what can be done

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:52.875
to make the world more inclusive for them.

00:02:53.416 --> 00:02:59.375
Alice: The first thing that's changed
productively over time has been travel.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.250
Being able to travel more and

00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:07.625
independently without having to always

00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:13.166
have somebody be with you and call for you
and that kind of thing.

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:15.500
So the automation part has been great.

00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:19.916
Some of the things that they've created
for like crossing

00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:22.791
streets have been more productive.

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:27.250
But there is part,
there are things that haven't changed,

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.500
like how you navigate the legal system
or your police stations

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.125
or those kinds of situations,
that hasn’t improved.

00:03:39.416 --> 00:03:43.875
And it's kind of sad to say that it's

00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:47.250
still lacking even with the ADA
and knowing that

00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:52.416
the accessibility portion
of even accessing your own police station

00:03:52.416 --> 00:03:56.291
or your county courthouse or whatever,
and to know that

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.125
it's still not done

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.625
in the medical area, in hospitals
and that kind of thing,

00:04:03.625 --> 00:04:06.666
those are all places
where some of those accommodations

00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:12.166
still aren't immediately available
when it kind of should be.

00:04:12.416 --> 00:04:13.791
Lydia: I totally agree.

00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:17.875
There are a number of gray areas
that still need to be accessed.

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.791
And the one area that does continue

00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:25.041
to need access, I would say,
is the area of pharmacology.

00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:29.250
They are now developing things
like ScriptTalk

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.541
so that medication bottles
can be read out loud.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.541
We've come a long way in that
respect, but there is more to be done

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.125
in that area as well.

00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:47.416
And that's just one of a number of areas
I think, that need to be addressed.

00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:50.375
There was a time that people

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:53.500
who were blind, people who are DeafBlind,

00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:56.500
were essentially institutionalized.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.125
They were put in, you know,
very bad situations.

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:04.916
I mean, we're talking
Helen Keller’s time, you know.

00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:09.375
She didn't have nearly the amount
of resources that we have today.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.125
And the attitudes
were much different.

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:15.416
And so, you know, those who did stand out

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:20.000
like Helen Keller back in their time,
were really recognized

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.625
as role models
for the rest of the community.

00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:24.375
So I think the societal attitudes

00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:25.125
So I think the societal attitudes

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:26.250
So I think the societal attitudes

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.250
have really changed quite a bit. And,

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.000
have really changed quite a bit. And,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.875
you know, we don't see people
in institutions anymore.

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:34.875
We see them out working in society.

00:05:35.375 --> 00:05:36.750
We're still not where we need to be.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.250
We have a long ways to go.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.708
