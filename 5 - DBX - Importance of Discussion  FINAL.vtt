00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.166
David: Somewhere between
10% and 20% of the population are people

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.250
with disabilities, right?

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.625
So if we're looking at working age persons
with disabilities, for example,

00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:14.125
I think we're going to use the American
Community Survey number, which is around

00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:18.000
12.5% of the population
as people with disabilities.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.500
Within that,
there is a cure for some disease.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500
There is somebody who can invent
a better widget or,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.875
you know, provide a better service
or be a leader

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:30.875
in some way that can help
improve the human condition for everybody.

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:34.750
So I'm interested in discovering
that and trying to bring that out.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:37.875
And so I think you do that by talking about it,

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:42.250
by having a dialog and trying
to move things forward.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:44.208
[music plays]

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:52.625
Kerry: So you think about disability as
an entire group, but there are subgroups.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:56.500
There are women with disability,
there are youth with disability,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.625
there are persons with intellectual
disability, persons with DeafBlindness.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.250
Now those groups tend to be left out.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.750
What we've been doing in the last
15 years has been about really trying

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.125
to pull out the voices from the shadow
and put them in the spotlight

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:16.875
and making sure that those marginalized
voices, such as persons

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:21.916
with DeafBlindness like myself,
were part of the conversation.

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:24.791
Fatou: Someone's got to step up
and utilize these platforms

00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:28.291
to get the word out there and let society
know what they need to know.

00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:31.500
The DeafBlind community,
as well as the greater blind community,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.416
are a small population,

00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:36.791
and because we're so few and far between,
people don't know much about us.

00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:41.166
We're not often recognized, but we still
have to keep getting that message out there.

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:44.541
Elaine: I would say that if you want to
learn more about DeafBlind people

00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:48.916
You have to get fully involved
with the community. Immerse yourself.

00:01:49.666 --> 00:01:53.791
We can learn from each other.
And you can learn about our problems and our struggles.

00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:56.666
So get out and just meet people.

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:59.666
It’s not about just being preached to

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.666
and preached, and preach, and preach,

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:03.333
and preach about what to do.

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.916
Get to meet us, and know us first.

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:10.791
David: Well really that is
the goal, is to make this topic

00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:13.541
more common
so that more people discuss it.

00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:15.666
If more people discuss it,
there'll be more ideas.

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:17.166
If there's more ideas,

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:20.458
then there can be more assistance
for people with disabilities

00:02:20.458 --> 00:02:23.416
to be more independent, more
self-determined, and have more freedom.

00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:27.916
Sarah: Nowadays, are people more aware of people
with disabilities compared to before?

00:02:27.916 --> 00:02:32.041
Yes. Where a long time ago
that wasn't even allowed.

00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:35.166
If you had any mental disability,

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:39.291
then you were put into an asylum,
so you were segregated.

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:44.166
And now we have deaf schools,
we have blind schools, you know,

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:46.666
so we have all those
specialized schools.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:50.291
So it's gone through
an evolution of its own.

00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:54.041
However, being aware is different

00:02:54.041 --> 00:02:58.458
than understanding
how you treat people with disabilities.

00:02:58.458 --> 00:03:00.375
That's what's really important.

00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:04.875
Fatou: What I want the general public
and society, people

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:08.625
who are not very familiar with DeafBlind
community and DeafBlind culture, to know

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.375
is that if there's anything that strikes
you as funny, just ask us about it.

00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:14.375
Be open minded.

00:03:15.458 --> 00:03:18.083
The more you ask,
the more you'll understand.

00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:21.458
Kerry: That's why it's so important to understand
that disability is something that

00:03:21.458 --> 00:03:26.583
we should all be invested in and learning
how to do better by all people.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:29.291
Fatou: The future is what you make it.

00:03:29.916 --> 00:03:32.666
But the question is,
will we be noticed more?

00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:35.166
Because what we have now isn't enough

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:36.916
and it could be so much more.

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:41.041
DeafBlind people just need to be
invited in into areas like acting,

00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:43.541
sports, really, anywhere
we can get recognition.

00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:45.666
So let's do something about that.

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:47.291
Get more of that.

00:03:47.541 --> 00:03:49.416
David: Putting people with disabilities

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:52.041
in places where other
people with disabilities

00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:56.291
can say, “Well, I want to do that,”
or, “look at what that person has achieved.

00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:57.166
I can achieve that.

00:03:57.166 --> 00:03:59.416
If that person did it, I can do it.”

00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:03.291
And so I just think back
throughout history that, how many times

00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:08.166
that's been done where somebody has read
a book and said, “I want to be like that”

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:11.916
or watched a film and said, “I
want to be like that” or read an article

00:04:11.916 --> 00:04:15.291
that said, “I want to do that”
or “that's inspired me to do that.”

00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:18.666
And so the story
for people with disabilities,

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:21.916
the more that it's told,
more people with disabilities

00:04:21.916 --> 00:04:28.291
have an opportunity to say,
“Well, I want to do that.”

00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:30.666
