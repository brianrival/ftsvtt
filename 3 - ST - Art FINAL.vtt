00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:10.416
Rafael: I remember seeing an artist once

00:00:11.416 --> 00:00:14.000
and I went up to him
and I watched him work.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.666
It was really cool.

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:20.500
So I went home, found some paper,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.416
found a pencil and
started drawing what I saw

00:00:30.875 --> 00:00:33.000
I started watching a TV show as well.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.750
It was Frankenstein.

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:38.250
I really liked that movie.

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:41.625
So I went to my desk,
got another piece of paper,

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:45.125
a pencil, and tried my best
to sketch Frankenstein's monster.

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:48.875
A lot of people have asked me,
“Wow! Yow you did that?”

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:50.500
Yeah, I did.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.875
So, yeah, I started at seven,
just fooling around and sketching

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:57.250
and having fun simply
because I saw that sketch artist working

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.500
and he inspired me
to want to be an artist.

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.375
My name is Rafael Morales,

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:05.625
and I have a nickname with people
who know me, “R” as in artist.

00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:08.125
[music plays]

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:12.125
I really like Sylvester Stallone.

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:14.875
I like him in Rocky,
I like him in Rambo.

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:16.375
When I was a kid growing up,

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:21.625
probably 13 or 14, I would draw him
and his face is really hard to draw.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:23.541
He's got some interesting eyes,

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:25.500
so it would take me a while
to get good at it.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.000
And the older I got, the more I practiced
until I got it just right.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.625
I guess it's just part of my personality
that I'm a very creative

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:37.125
and thoughtful person

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.750
and I like to make adjustments

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.500
and changes as I draw.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.500
Sometimes what I draw
is not exactly what I'm looking at,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.250
but I definitely want to get the face
and make sure that that's recognizable.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.375
But other times I'll get very creative
about the rest of it,

00:01:52.375 --> 00:01:55.666
whether it's the background
or the characterization.

00:01:55.666 --> 00:01:57.541
And I like to play
around with my art as well.

00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:00.875
[music plays]

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.375
So I was born deaf,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.375
and I remember thinking
when I was about five years old

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:16.000
that I was having difficulty seeing.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.375
That's probably when
my eyesight began to change.

00:02:19.875 --> 00:02:22.375
Colors didn't seem normal to me
like they used to.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.625
They began to blur together, and I
couldn't always differentiate the colors.

00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:30.875
When I would cross the street, many times
I wouldn't see cars coming

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:34.000
and I almost got hit
multiple times as a kid.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.375
I didn't realize

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:39.125
that I had no peripheral vision
and I couldn't see oncoming traffic.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.541
The older I got, the harder
it was to see,

00:02:41.916 --> 00:02:44.750
especially even during regular daytime.

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:51.250
Currently, now I'm working on my iPad

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.250
and some of the different techniques are wonderful.

00:02:54.625 --> 00:02:58.875
Pencil drawing,
using watercolor, design style,

00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:01.500
oil design.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.250
I can adjust all those,

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:07.125
so that allows me a lot of options
and different techniques.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.250
And I don't see colors
as well as I used to,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.125
it's very difficult
to see shades and words.

00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:16.041
I have to get very close up.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.750
20 years ago I could see very well
and I knew what I was drawing.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.500
Now it's very difficult
to see words or print.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.250
I can't read books.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.500
Colors are not as clear
as they used to be.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.750
And I know that I'm going to go
completely blind.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.000
I grew up drawing and then I became blind.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.625
So I wonder, am I the only one out there?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.375
There's got to be somebody else out there
who is deaf and blind and can also

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:41.875
be an artist.

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:46.125
Yes. My neighbor,
Chris Cook, he's fully blind

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:49.875
and he makes amazing clay sculptures.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.000
He's got a talent for it.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.875
[music plays]

00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:08.875
Chris: My name is Chris Cook.

00:04:08.875 --> 00:04:12.250
I'm a DeafBlind person currently
living in Los Angeles, California.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.125
I'm an artist primarily working in clay
and make many things out of it.

00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:20.125
I started working with clay
when I was about 16,

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:23.000
and I've worked with
all different kinds, like kiln clay,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.625
sculpture oven baked clay and air dry clay.

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.750
I make mostly animals out of clay

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.041
and sometimes figures
of people, but not as often.

00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:35.333
Above this display is a miniature town
on the kitchen counter

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:37.250
between the living room and the kitchen.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.291
It has a bay out front,
made partly of blue foam,

00:04:40.291 --> 00:04:43.291
as well as buildings, trees, and vehicles.

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:45.708
Most of the buildings
are made out of paper,

00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:47.708
except for the airport, which is plastic

00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:51.208
and the church,
which is mud with a metal roof.

00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:53.375
It took me several weeks
to make Cooksville.

00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:56.125
Yeah, I named it after myself
after I was done with it.

00:04:57.916 --> 00:05:00.166
I sell my sculptures to make money.

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:04.041
Everything you see along my walls is for
sale for different prices.

00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:08.791
I use my teletype for around people
who don't know how to sign.

00:05:08.791 --> 00:05:11.291
It's a device
that looks like a typewriter.

00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:15.041
When people type on it, I can read
what they're writing on the other side

00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:16.916
in braille.

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:19.416
I really enjoy listening to music.

00:05:19.416 --> 00:05:22.458
My favorite kinds are rock and roll
and country music.

00:05:22.625 --> 00:05:24.000
I can't make out the singing.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.750
I can only make out the rhythm.

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:29.041
I used to be able to see
and hear in my early childhood,

00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:33.750
but I started to lose my hearing
when I was 13 and my sight when I was 15.

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:38.375
By age 16, I’d lost all of my sight
and most of my hearing.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.041
It was hard to accept the losses,
especially my hearing.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.666
Rafael: Some of the things that I've adjusted

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.250
is I have to be careful
with where I'm focusing.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.541
I have to see up close
with what I'm trying to draw.

00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:56.875
Sometimes I'll have this weird feeling,
some internal feeling

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.625
and it makes me feel like I can't see
as well as I used to.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.000
So I have to be very careful

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.625
when that feeling comes up,
I get much more emotional as I do my art.

00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:11.041
Sometimes I miss details, I miss things,

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:15.666
and what I'm drawing doesn't
look exactly like what I intend.

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.250
It usually turns out well,

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.916
and I know I'm an artist
and my art has changed.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.250
I like putting my art into competitions.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.250
I've won several different awards.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.375
I'm very fortunate

00:06:28.375 --> 00:06:31.875
I think that I'm a skilled artist
and I've nurtured those skills.

00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:35.875
It's just that I'm losing my eyesight
and I just have to create.

00:06:35.875 --> 00:06:37.791
I have to put out there what I'm feeling.

00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:48.916
As far as the future.

00:06:48.916 --> 00:06:51.166
I don't know what
it's going to look like. I don't know.

00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:55.000
I'm just going based on the inspiration
and the feelings that I have.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.250
I'll keep doing my art as long as I can.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.125
I can't really say exactly, but I think
I’m going to continue in some way or another.

00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:04.000
Maybe I'll transfer
and do sculpture with clay.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.375
I used to do a lot of pen art.

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:08.625
I'm very good with pen and ink art,

00:07:08.625 --> 00:07:11.750
and I should be able to still do that
even if I go fully blind.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.625
But I don't know.

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:14.125
It hasn't happened yet.

00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:16.000
I'm going to keep trying, that's for sure.

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:18.916
I don't think that I need to see
what something exactly

00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:21.000
looks like for me to try to draw it.

00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:24.416
I can do things in grayscale
and I can approximate.

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:27.000
I know in the future, like I had mentioned,

00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:30.458
that I may well go completely blind,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
but I keep up with my work
and I keep up with my skills as best as I can

00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:39.416
