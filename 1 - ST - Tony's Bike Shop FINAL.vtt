[music plays]

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:13.125
Tony: I have a lot of experience
in bicycle repair.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.125
When I was actually 13 years old,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.250
it was my first job
repairing bikes in Ohio.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.250
So I did it for a year or two,

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.666
and then was fired
and I was fired because I would

00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:35.875
often blow off work and to go a party
and hang out with friends.

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:37.500
So they fired me.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.125
Tony: I am Tony, Tony Giordano.
I am completely blind and deaf.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Many years ago,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.500
I was a world traveler.
My vision was fine.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.125
I would travel the world.

00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:57.375
I worked at Amato’s.

00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:59.500
So let's say a vehicle was in an accident.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.875
I'd remove the parts
that were damaged in the collision,

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:04.750
make the necessary repairs, replace parts.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.791
I would test drive it, make sure
everything worked properly.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.750
I was also a welder
for more than 30 years.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.125
I would do a lot of welding.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:18.875
I would be welding for 8 hours
a day, every day

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:23.500
until my left eye
started losing vision in 2014.

00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:28.500
I went through several exams
and evaluations, at which point

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.750
they told me the blurriness in my left
eye will eventually happen to my right eye as well.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.500
I asked the doctor,
“Am I going to become blind?”

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:40.875
At which the doctor said, “Yes, absolutely.”

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.000
I was shocked. I didn't know what to do

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.750
[music plays]

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.500
[mechanical sounds]

00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:02.916
In November of 2018,
my right eye lost all of its vision

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:05.750
and I’d already lost all
the vision in my left eye.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.500
My roommate actually
called my family for me.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.750
They flew out to help me.

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:13.625
They packed up everything

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:16.375
and then flew me over to North Carolina

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:18.375
to live with my brother for a while.

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:25.375
I went home and I couldn't work
anymore. I applied for disability.

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:26.625
I was sad.

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:29.000
I was frustrated with
all of my vision problems.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.375
Everything was incredibly
frustrating for me.

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:37.250
I was having to rely so much on my family
to help me with everything.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.500
[drilling sound]

00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:47.875
You know, where I live it’s very rural.

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:50.166
There's lots of mountains and hills.

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:52.750
It's a really small community.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.250
There're not many deaf people there.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.666
There's not many blind people there.

00:02:56.666 --> 00:03:00.750
They didn't know about how to communicate
with Blind and Deaf people.

00:03:01.125 --> 00:03:05.250
I started learning basic braille
and it was a struggle.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.625
I was not good at it.

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:11.250
I would practice day after day
and it was still quite difficult for me.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.125
My sister called the North Carolina
State for the blind and deaf,

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:18.291
and that representative’s
name was Savannah.

00:03:18.291 --> 00:03:20.125
Savannah came to visit

00:03:20.125 --> 00:03:22.500
and we did some tactile
sign language together.

00:03:22.916 --> 00:03:25.500
I had never used tactile
sign language prior to that,

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.250
and it was awkward at first.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.250
I was fumbling to get the information.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.500
She recommended that I go to HKNC in New York.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.125
She said they could help me tremendously.

00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:38.000
I’d be able to learn braille,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.750
I'd be able to learn about cooking,
about how to use a cane for mobility,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.875
at which point I then decided I would
go to the Helen Keller National Center.

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:49.000
[music plays]

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.500
I love arts. I'm really great at it.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.375
When I had vision, you know,
I used to make projects here and there,

00:04:05.541 --> 00:04:08.041
but now without vision,

00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:11.375
how do I make various
artistic designs, you know,

00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:13.125
and make sure
everything is symmetrical?

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:20.125
Another class I took was on mobility.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.916
I really trained a lot in mobility
to make sure that I wouldn't

00:04:23.916 --> 00:04:28.250
bump my face on any objects nearby.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.625
I also took a cooking class
in the independent living department

00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:37.291
[music plays]

00:04:45.666 --> 00:04:48.666
My instructor is also blind and deaf.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.500
I've learned a lot in all of my classes.

00:05:05.125 --> 00:05:06.666
I'm not a 100% independent.

00:05:06.666 --> 00:05:11.000
I'm still working on enhancing
my skills and learning more.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.750
[indistinct chatter]

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:14.750
My vocational instructor and I

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.083
went to work at the bike co-op.

00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:23.083
The manager's name is Paul
and the two of us could not communicate.

00:05:23.083 --> 00:05:26.458
I did have with me my communication cards,
which I would show him.

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:27.333
He would read.

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:31.083
He would flip through.
But communication was tough.

00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:35.500
Paul looked around and found an old bike.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.125
He put that old bike up on a bike stand
and told me that there was an issue

00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:43.458
with the brakes.
So I went about cranking the bike.

00:05:43.458 --> 00:05:46.208
Specifically looking at the gears.

00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:50.333
I would shift the gears one by one
to check how the bike was moving.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.333
And with that I noticed
there was something not right.

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:59.458
Interpreter: It’s In bad shape. And the reason
I know is because I cranked it

00:05:59.458 --> 00:06:04.958
and it wasn't turning right.
Both breaks should be connected

00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:08.958
Tony: Paul checked out the bike
and gave me a thumbs down.

00:06:16.708 --> 00:06:20.958
Paul: Basically I had to push the other guy aside
because it was a person, an intermediary,

00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:25.625
and I took Tony's hands and I put them
where I wanted them to be.

00:06:25.625 --> 00:06:27.875
And then it was like
the light bulb came on.

00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:29.333
He goes, “Oh, yeah, okay, I get it.”

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.458
Tony: I was able to identify the problem.
I made the necessary repairs.

00:06:36.458 --> 00:06:39.625
I connected the cables,
I tested the brakes

00:06:40.208 --> 00:06:42.833
and the bike ran very well.

00:06:43.458 --> 00:06:46.250
When I was done, I called
Paul over, at which point

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.333
he tested the bike and did an inspection
and said that everything was great.

00:06:50.333 --> 00:06:53.958
He gave me a thumbs up,
which I felt tactilely, and I knew

00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:55.708
I had passed his test.

00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:57.833
[music plays]

00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:00.833
Paul: Between the two of us, like you saw,
we're basically talking bike.

00:07:01.208 --> 00:07:04.208
So he doesn’t need to speak
or see or anything

00:07:06.083 --> 00:07:09.083
He caught right on, you know,
because there was desire to do it.

00:07:09.583 --> 00:07:11.583
And the desire is the big thing.

00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:16.208
You know, so, he's good to go.

00:07:16.208 --> 00:07:18.458
I mean, he fixes bikes.

00:07:21.083 --> 00:07:24.958
Tony: Looking back, all of the frustration
I previously had thinking about

00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:29.708
how I had to rely on others all the time
and how emotional that made me.

00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:32.583
I've now been able to put that aside.

00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:35.208
I've been able to gain independence.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.208
I still continue learning
in all areas in braille.

00:07:42.208 --> 00:07:44.458
I definitely want to
get better in braille.

00:07:44.458 --> 00:07:47.333
I want to learn more.
I want to really understand it.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.208
Even with mobility,

00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:53.458
you know how to how to get out
in case of an emergency and stairs.

00:07:53.458 --> 00:07:55.833
There's so much more I want to learn.

00:07:56.958 --> 00:07:59.041
