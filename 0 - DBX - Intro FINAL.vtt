Scott:  I always wear my hearing aids.

00:00:04.541 --> 00:00:07.125
Unless I want to quickly end
an argument or something.

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:09.625
Then I turn them off
and I don't hear anything.

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:11.875
So I win no matter what.

00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:19.291
Anne: And I was at my grandparents’ house
and I was going down the stairs in the dark

00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:21.833
and I was shuffling with my feet

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.875
to feel where I was going.

00:00:24.875 --> 00:00:27.000
My parents were like, “Shhh...”

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.416
you know, and they knew.

00:00:28.416 --> 00:00:30.375
Fatou: Something just wasn't right.

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:35.000
I realize all of a sudden that I'm missing
passes and I keep dropping the ball.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.500
It wasn't until later that my older sister

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.875
explained to me what DeafBlindness was.

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.875
Sarah: I really struggled in the beginning
with my Deaf identity

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:51.375
because I felt like
I was never hearing enough,

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:53.625
yet I was never deaf enough.

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:58.250
Carl: DeafBlind people put both blind
people and deaf people in a conundrum

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.041
because we as DeafBlind people have both things,
which neither one of them want.

00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:04.000
[laughter]

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.875
Rebecca: If you’re deaf you rely
very heavily on your sight.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.416
But when you're losing your vision
and you don't have hearing,

00:01:10.416 --> 00:01:12.375
how do you process and take in the world?

Anne: My name is Anne Cantrill,
everyone calls me Annie.

00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:19.625
Carl: My name is Carl Richardson.

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:20.875
Rebecca: I’m Rebecca Alexander.

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:22.916
Fatou: My name is Fatou Sankanu.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.500
Sarah: My name is Sarah Morrison.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.875
David: It’s David D’Arcangelo

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:29.500
I'm the commissioner of the Massachusetts
Commission for the Blind.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.208
People with disabilities are everybody.

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:32.958
They’re our friends, they’re our family.

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.666
Disability is the story of us.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.750
Fatou: If there's anything that strikes you
as funny, just ask us about it.

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:39.750
Be open minded.

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:42.666
The more you ask,
the more you'll understand.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.625
Sarah: Being aware is different
than understanding

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:49.250
how you treat people with disabilities.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.791
Carl: Everybody has obstacles to overcome,
mine are just more visible to people

00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:55.000
to watch and observe.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.666
But what sets people apart is how we

00:01:58.125 --> 00:01:59.750
overcome and deal with them.
