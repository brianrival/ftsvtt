00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.875
Anne: You know, my husband
has a very loud voice.

00:00:06.125 --> 00:00:07.750
One of the reasons I married him.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:08.875
I can hear him.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.125
Rene: That's a top secret, by the way, you know...

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.750
I met her in the dorms.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.625
Carl: There were basically two criteria
when I was dating:

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:19.250
one, she’s got to have a driver’s license,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.500
because I want to go places and I can't drive.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000
[music plays]

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:32.208
Anne: Well, I first met
my husband through a friend,

00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:34.958
and it's funny because

00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:36.333
she was not setting us up.

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.333
She did not want us to get together.

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:39.708
But anyway.

00:00:39.708 --> 00:00:42.708
I didn't know that she had told him
that I was DeafBlind.

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:46.583
And of course, he was like,
“Well then, how do you communicate with her?

00:00:46.583 --> 00:00:48.000
How do you talk to her?”

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.708
And then he met me.
And again, I had better vision then,

00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:56.333
so I kind of told him about the hearing
loss, but I was still trying to fake it.

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:58.208
We were at a restaurant,

00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:02.583
and I think I went into the bathroom
and I bumped into the tray...

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:03.833
...you know, going in.

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:08.833
And then when I came out and I said,
“oh, you know, it's dark in here

00:01:08.833 --> 00:01:10.833
I have trouble seeing.”
And he goes, “it's okay.”

00:01:11.083 --> 00:01:15.458
And then we started dating and
a few weeks into dating I told him I had

00:01:15.958 --> 00:01:20.333
vision impairment that I had, you know...
but I didn't tell him I was legally blind.

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:24.083
And finally a few weeks later
he said, “baby, I know.”

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:26.333
And I'm like, “oh, how did you know?”

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.208
Well, he's like, “Nicole told me, first of all.”

00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:30.708
He said, “second of all,
the first night I met you,

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.333
you were walking out of the bathroom
and you were totally lost.”

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.958
He’s like, “you didn't know where
we were sitting, you didn’t know...”

00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:38.458
He’s like, “Anyone could tell.”

00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:40.458
So that's when I'm like,
okay, I'm not faking it.

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:41.333
[laughter]

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.708
I'm not fooling anyone.

00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:45.833
Brian: We met online through
a dating app called Match.

00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:49.708
And so we started talking
and messaging back and forth.

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:54.458
And we just decided to go on
a first date through a state park.

00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:58.208
It was my idea, it was a state park
I've been to before.

00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:01.708
Me and my guide dog, we've done the trail
before and know it pretty well.

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:04.833
My wife doesn't have

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.083
a lot of experience
with that particular place.

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:10.958
So we went there for our first date and

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.833
it was a lot of fun.

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:18.083
You know, it was probably the first time
that my wife met a guide dog.

00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:22.083
And so there was a little bit of a
learning curve there.

00:02:22.583 --> 00:02:24.708
On our first date

00:02:25.083 --> 00:02:27.333
the dog had to use the bathroom.

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:31.208
I lost track of where the poop had landed

00:02:32.083 --> 00:02:34.958
so I asked her where the poop was

00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:37.333
and trying to find it, I accidentally stepped in it.

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:40.833
So it was a comical first date

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:44.458
and luckily it worked out. We're still together.

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:47.333
It’s been about six years.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.583
Carl: That was back in 2002.

00:02:50.083 --> 00:02:53.208
At the time I was working at WGBH

00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:58.208
and a friend of hers
who teaches here at Boston University

00:02:58.208 --> 00:03:01.083
who I went to high school
with needed access

00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:04.458
to a Frontline video
so she could use it in a class.

00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:05.458
And I said, “I can get it.”

00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:07.458
She said, “I'll tell you what, I'm
going to take you out to dinner.”

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:12.708
So I went out to dinner
and we were in a bar slash restaurant.

00:03:13.208 --> 00:03:17.583
And Megan, my wife, who was also
a professor at Boston University

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:20.458
walked in...on another date

00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:27.083
and later said to our mutual friend,
“can you give that guy my phone number?”

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:32.333
I, at first, said no

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:33.333
but my friend said,

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:36.208
“oh, Carl it was dark, you didn’t see her,
she has red hair.”

00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:37.958
I've got a thing for redheads.

00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:41.458
So we went out to a local Irish pub.

00:03:42.458 --> 00:03:44.958
We met at 7 o’clock.

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:49.083
and we got kicked out at 1am

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:51.333
when the bar closed, at last call.

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:53.500
We talked about everything.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.833
Politics, religion,

00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:58.958
literature, film, history.

00:03:59.083 --> 00:04:01.375
I wanted an intelligent woman,

00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:04.083
and Megan is incredibly intelligent.

00:04:04.083 --> 00:04:06.458
And I did something I had
never done that night.

00:04:06.958 --> 00:04:09.583
When we left and departed,
the minute I got home,

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:14.958
I called her right back and said,
“I enjoyed meeting you. Let’s do it again.”

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:17.333
She played the hard to get
and waited like three days,

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:20.833
and I was freaking out for three days
whether I was going to hear from her again.

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:25.208
But I did, and we dated for almost
two years before we got married.

00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:29.208
[music plays]

00:04:31.666 --> 00:04:35.291
Brian: It didn't really matter to either of us.

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:41.541
I would have been comfortable dating anyone
with any kind of disability or not.

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:45.916
I think the nice thing about my wife

00:04:45.916 --> 00:04:49.166
is that she’s a special education teacher,

00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:52.416
so she’s pretty comfortable being around
people with disabilities

00:04:52.416 --> 00:04:55.291
and working with students with disabilities.

00:04:55.291 --> 00:05:01.041
Obviously dating and marrying someone with
disabilities is a whole other ballgame

00:05:01.041 --> 00:05:04.041
and I’m an adult and not a kid, so...

00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:09.666
our conversations and dialogues are very
different than the ones she's used to in school

00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:13.791
but I think it didn't really matter
for either one of us.

00:05:14.666 --> 00:05:17.291
Carl: But my wife will tell you
I never talk about it.

00:05:17.541 --> 00:05:20.916
And it's frustrating to her for us as a couple

00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:26.041
because she doesn't know what I can't
see and what I can’t hear

00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:28.041
and when I'm picking up things
and when I'm not.

00:05:28.041 --> 00:05:30.416
So we've had to work on our communication.

00:05:30.916 --> 00:05:34.291
What I want,
what I don't want, when I want it.

00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:38.541
We live in the city here in Boston,
so we have a galley kitchen.

00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:40.791
One day she was making tea.

00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:41.541
I didn't know it.

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.666
I couldn't hear the tea kettle going.

00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:46.916
I burnt my hand, you know, I exploded,

00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:49.666
“how dare you?” You know...
it’s her house too!

00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:51.416
She can make tea.

00:05:51.416 --> 00:05:55.041
So, you know, you have to adapt
and you have to reinvent yourself.

00:05:55.291 --> 00:05:59.291
And this is probably the fifth or
sixth time I'm having to reinvent myself.

00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:02.291
And, you know, Megan

00:06:02.291 --> 00:06:05.916
tends to see people
as who they are and not what they are.

00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:11.916
Anne: So, you know, we kept dating
and we talked about it some.

00:06:11.916 --> 00:06:14.291
And then, you know, his family,

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:19.958
they love me now, but they were like,
“are you sure you can handle marrying

00:06:19.958 --> 00:06:24.083
someone who's going blind and who's,
you know, DeafBlind?”

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:26.458
And his friend did

00:06:26.458 --> 00:06:29.458
although his friend also warned me about him.

00:06:29.458 --> 00:06:30.708
[laugther]

00:06:30.708 --> 00:06:33.833
But, you know, we just decided
we were going to do it.

00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:37.708
And when we got married,
you know, we talked about having kids.

00:06:37.708 --> 00:06:39.958
He was nervous about it.

00:06:39.958 --> 00:06:43.333
He thought we should
have genetic testing, so...

00:06:44.708 --> 00:06:46.708
