Carl: At first it's hard.
When you get your first dog,

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:09.291
it takes a long time to learn
to put your trust in a dog

00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:11.875
to potentially save my life.

00:00:11.875 --> 00:00:14.416

00:00:15.583 --> 00:00:18.666
Fatou: The first time I started
using my cane, it was awkward.

00:00:18.875 --> 00:00:21.250
It felt weird having people staring at me.

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:23.000
Rosanna: Cane travel sucks.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.250
[laughter]

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.875
Greg: At night I would bump
into everything and everybody

00:00:26.875 --> 00:00:29.458
and people would get mad at me,
and I am like, you know?

00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:32.458
But now having the cane,
it's like parting the Red Sea.

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:35.666
Everybody gets out of my way as I'm
walking down the street with my cane.

00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:41.041
Lydia: If you're a seasoned user,
you can feel where you are in space

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:44.250
and give you clues
about where you need to go.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.375

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.500
Linda: My dog saved my life.

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.875
I wouldn't be here talking to you
right now because he would have killed me.

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:53.083
He was flying.

00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:55.916
Korrine: It's not a pet. It's
not just a regular dog.

00:00:55.916 --> 00:00:58.375
They're held to really high
standards to keep us safe.

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:00.125
And they have a job to do.

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:04.000
Brian: You have to 100% trust that the dog
is not gonna run you into a wall.

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.375
And believe it or not,

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:08.166
they probably will run you
into a wall once or twice.

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:09.250

00:01:11.416 --> 00:01:13.250
Brian: I'm Brian Switzer.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.833
Carl: My name is Carl Richardson.

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:16.958
Fatou: My name is Fatou Sankanu.

00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:18.750
Korrine: My name's Korrine Herlth.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.291
Greg: Gregory Samuels.

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:22.125
Lydia: Lydia Olmstead.

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:23.875
Rebecca: I’m Rebecca Alexander.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.916
Kerry: My name is Kerry Thompson.

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:28.208
No matter how much you ask people

00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:32.041
no amount of preparing
really ever prepares you for it.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.250
Carl: It's just an unbelievable feeling.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.083
And the dogs even take pride in
their work when they do something right

00:01:38.083 --> 00:01:40.875
they'll look at you like,
“I did that right, didn’t I?

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:42.291
Yeah, tell me I'm a good boy.”

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:43.291
You know
[laughter]

00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:44.666
It's just an amazing feeling.

00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:47.125
Linda> They guide you, they become part of you.

00:01:47.125 --> 00:01:50.958
They give you self-esteem,
independence, confidence,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.291
and you become a whole.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.125
Yeah, you become whole.

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:57.708
