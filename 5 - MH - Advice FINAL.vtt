00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.541
Fatou: I would like to be a mentor
because there are many DeafBlind

00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:08.250
people out there living in isolation,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.791
tucked away from society,

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:12.250
and it's not easy
to come out of your shell.

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.125
I want to be the person
who helps them out of the oblivion

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:17.000
and get their ass
moving on with their life.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.625
[music plays]

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:29.875
Rebecca: We think of disability as sad,

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:36.625
as gloom and doom,
as depression, as incapability,

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.666
and we don't think about people

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.500
with disabilities as being dynamic.

00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:45.375
Alice: We're much more flexible
than people think.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750
It's not that complicated.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.666
It doesn't matter how my
mechanics work, it's how I live.

00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:54.250
I don't fake it.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.000
I don't whitewash it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.250
I don't, you know, Jerry-rig it.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.250
I just work around it
to make anything possible

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.916
because I believe that everything is.

00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:10.625
Rebecca: We encourage people to try
to see the dimensions of disability

00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:14.416
either within themselves
or in other people.

00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:19.125
The most malleable people,
the people who are most creative,

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:22.791
the people who are most able
to sort of roll with things and go with

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:26.041
and go with the flow are
my friends with disabilities.

00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:30.750
And so instead of looking at someone
with a disability or seeing yourself

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:34.208
with someone as a disability
for the things that you can't do,

00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:38.750
I want you to see all of
the things that you are and try to,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.791
if you can, let that part of
yourself shine without having

00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:45.750
to feel like you have to
make excuses or that you have to

00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:49.958
somehow feel like
your disability is what defines you.

00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:51.875

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.041
Alice: If you don't have blindness skills,
there are blindness centers.

00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:01.541
There are commissions
of the blind in most states,

00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:04.625
There are divisions
of the deaf in most states.

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:08.416
Latch on, track them down
and grab whatever you can.

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:12.666
Fatou: What's important is that you
get to know people who are open minded,

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.583
who want to understand
you and support you.

00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:16.625
Alice: An ally it is not just your friend.

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:18.541
They go through what you go through.

00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:23.541
They help you traverse
whatever we're trying to traverse.

00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:28.125
Korrine: That felt empowering to be able
to just have a community

00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:31.625
and have a group of people that really
understood where I was coming from

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:35.666
and to be able to go into a space
and feel safe and feel comfortable,

00:02:35.916 --> 00:02:37.250
and feel welcomed.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.083
I'm not alone in this, you know.

00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:43.375
Fatou: And, you know, feel free to share your
experiences with other DeafBlind people.

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:46.541
If you share them with others,
you'll gain an even deeper understanding

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:48.375
and be better prepared for the future.

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:51.375
Alice: Learn how to cook, please
parents, teach them!

00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:54.000
You know, do your laundry,
all those kinds of things.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.375
Somebody needs to teach you
or you need to acquire those skills.

00:02:57.625 --> 00:03:01.916
So you need to know what you need to know,

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:04.916
or find a mentor that
will help you know that.

00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:10.250
Rebecca: I do think that there is this part of me
that wants to fight for disability rights

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:14.750
and that also feels very angry
and frustrated just like everybody else.

00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:20.375
But I can either sit back and be angry
about it and complain about it.

00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:23.041
I can post online about it. It's futile.

00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:24.291
It does absolutely nothing.

00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:26.291
It doesn't improve anything.

00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:28.791
It only adds fuel to the fire.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:33.041
The only thing I can do is
try to make some tangible step

00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:36.625
towards showing other people what I think

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:40.125
would be a better
way of handling disability

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:43.750
or interacting with people with disabilities
or living with a disability.

00:03:43.916 --> 00:03:45.041
Korrine: This is who I am.

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:47.750
Try to understand where I'm coming from.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.041
You know, you might experience
things differently and that's okay.

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:52.041
But this is where I'm at.

00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:53.916
This is what I have to offer.

00:03:53.916 --> 00:03:56.750
If you don't like that,
I'm sorry. Too bad.

00:03:57.166 --> 00:04:00.916
But you know, like I said,
I'm proud of who I am.

00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:04.791
I'm proud of where I come from,
I've come a long way.

00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:08.916
