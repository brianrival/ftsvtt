00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:11.720
Chris Woodfill speaking.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.056
And I would like to introduce you to Doug Roland.

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:16.099
And he's a filmmaker

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.226
for the project we're going to be working on

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:19.686
called "Feeling Through."

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:22.105
>>Back in August of 2011

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:23.898
I was coming home late one night.

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:26.192
I was out in the East Village in New York City.

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:27.652
And I saw this man

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:29.821
standing on a street corner by himself.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:30.822
And as I got closer

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:32.741
I saw that he was holding a sign

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:35.076
that said he needed help crossing the street

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.703
and that he was deaf and blind.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:37.620
This is the first time

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.414
I had ever encountered a DeafBlind person.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:42.250
So initially I tried to talk to him.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.502
And quickly realized that wasn't going to work.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:47.380
But when I tapped him, he had a notepad.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.425
He wrote to me that he needed a certain bus stop.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:52.761
So I walked him over to the bus stop.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.096
I didn't want him to sit and wait by himself.

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:56.222
So I wanted to find a way

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.390
to let him know that I'd wait with him.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:01:01.061
And I kind of intuitively just took his hand

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.688
and started writing one letter at a time on his palm.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:09.277
The man who had written his name as A-R-T-Z, Artz

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:11.404
is how I knew him in that conversation.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.656
He was just a really charasmatic,

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:15.950
open-hearted, warm person.

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:20.997
I was inspired to write a short film about it.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:24.292
I reached out to the Helen Keller National Center

00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.586
but they're pretty busy over there.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:30.423
>>I was a bit skeptical about it.

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:34.010
Because I had never received any call

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.678
like that in the past.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.890
>>I remember initially

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.726
I was like, I'm not so sure about this.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.854
>>I was politely persistent in reaching out

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:46.856
a number of times through emails and calls.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.569
>>I believe it was a lengthy voice message from Doug

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.572
that I learned about the idea of the film.

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:57.158
>>There are not DeafBlind actors

00:01:57.158 --> 00:01:59.869
portraying DeafBlind characters in the media.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.871
That's the whole reason we're standing here today.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:02.747
And why we've come up here.

00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:04.165
And why we've been connecting

00:02:04.165 --> 00:02:05.041
with everyone in the community.

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:08.461
Because we really want to tell this story accurately.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.754
And authentically.

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:13.174
>>I remember sitting in the lobby of this hotel

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:16.553
and meeting with Doug and the team.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:19.305
So I was able to talk to Doug in detail

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.224
about what inspired the story.

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:22.350
>>Right from the start

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.019
I knew I that I wanted to cast a DeafBlind actor.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.064
>>It's not common that we're going to see

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:30.775
the face of these people in media.

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:34.237
It's a sort of breakthrough. It's a first.

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:36.656
>>It's never happened before.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.493
I can't think of anybody who is DeafBlind

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:43.496
who has ever been cast in any type of movie.

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:46.207
>>It was very obvious to myself

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:47.959
and two of my colleagues.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.211
And we were very excited.

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:53.381
>>Doug told us his story about meeting this guy

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.258
seven years ago in New York.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.802
And I said, I bet we can find him.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.470
>>Within three hours

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.389
I got an email from Cathy Kirscher

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.974
who was a part of that initial meeting

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:05.393
telling me that we found him.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.812
>>It became pretty clear who it was.

00:03:09.063 --> 00:03:10.773
>>Debbie Fiderer goes

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:14.277
Hispanic guy, New York, tactile sign - it's Artie.

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:16.362
>>At least we know who it is.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:17.739
It's this man named Artemio.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:22.702
We would love to reunite with Artemio

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.579
who's inspired this story.

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:26.414
>>And then it became a quest.

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:28.750
Where is Artemio living at this time?

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:32.795
>>The sad part is we couldn't find Artie after that.

00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:35.381
He has no contact with email and all of that.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.718
But that's how small and tight this community is.

00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:41.262
>>For months and months and months

00:03:41.554 --> 00:03:42.847
they couldn't find Artemio.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:44.849
>>People basically were saying

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.060
I don't think we're going to be able to find him.

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.982
>>I knew that there was so much for me to learn

00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:54.025
about the community.

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:56.986
But also that I was going to really need help

00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:59.989
finding potential actors to fill this role.

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.283
>>I remember starting to think in my mind

00:04:02.283 --> 00:04:05.453
of who could be potential candidates

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:06.704
for Doug to interview.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:08.998
>>You can come sit here.

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:13.169
>>So how would I encounter this person?

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.463
Would it be just walking on the street?

00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:20.593
>>That's initially how the other character meets him.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.470
So I'd love to just jump right in

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.847
and get to know you a little bit more.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.356
We'd be using two cameras

00:04:34.148 --> 00:04:36.192
to capture the scenes

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:38.820
in a more nuanced and efficient way.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.614
>>Trying to figure out their communication style

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:42.782
and their communcation method

00:04:42.782 --> 00:04:45.159
so that I can interpret what's going on

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.869
was challenging at times.

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:49.455
>>Interpreting and translation are very different.

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:50.456
An interpretation

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.500
is always going to be an interpretation.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.503
It's going to be me trying my best

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.005
to get where you're at.

00:04:57.171 --> 00:04:58.464
It's not a direct translation.

00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:02.385
>>There might be one word in English

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:06.097
that I might have eight different ways to sign it

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:08.099
based on all of the other words around it

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.058
and what your intent is.

00:05:09.058 --> 00:05:10.101
So my goal

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:12.353
is to interpret the meaning and the essence

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.814
in the manner in which you convey it

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:16.774
so that the deaf or DeafBlind person

00:05:16.774 --> 00:05:17.942
will understand it

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.110
and be able to respond accordingly.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:21.738
>>At one point in the middle of the day

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.699
we had a little bit of a break between auditions.

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.119
>>You know, we have options that are not on the list.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.537
I don't know if this is good enough for you.

00:05:29.537 --> 00:05:31.831
But if you like, do you want to meet with Robert?

00:05:31.831 --> 00:05:32.790
He works in our kitchen.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:33.833
We can pull him over here.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:34.876
>>Yeah, I'd love to.

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:38.546
>>I think he might be a good candidate.

00:05:43.384 --> 00:05:45.428
>>I know you just got pulled in here.

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:48.639
So I'll explain a little bit why we're here.

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:50.433
We are making a movie.

00:05:52.101 --> 00:05:53.561
>>Wait, who's going to be the actor?

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:54.687
You?

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:56.397
Oh, I know.

00:05:56.397 --> 00:05:57.774
I'm just joking. I'm just joking.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:58.983
It made me feel so excited.

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:00.860
I was like, wait, are you serious?

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.570
I'm auditioning for something?

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.114
You have to remember.

00:06:05.114 --> 00:06:07.283
I work ten to six, Monday to Friday.

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:09.660
>>Don't worry about that.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.038
We would excuse you from work.

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:13.873
>>Are you sure?

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:16.125
>>Yes, it's only for a few days.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.003
>>If I become a movie star

00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:20.380
I don't want to be in trouble with you.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.383
And if I'm late, it's on you.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.760
>>Don't worry about it. We will excuse you.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.678
>>But now I felt like this is my dream coming true.

00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:29.305
That I'm sitting here in this room

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:30.515
auditioning for a movie.

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:32.725
I'm getting so excited about this.

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:34.185
I love being on camera.

00:06:34.268 --> 00:06:35.561
>>I'm glad to hear that.

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:38.898
Genuinely, the moment Robert walked in the room

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:40.400
I was like, this is our guy.

00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:42.568
So we were really, really excited

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:46.322
to call up Robert shortly after

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:47.740
and let him know that he'd gotten the role.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.617
And he was very excited.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.702
>>I just remember one day I was at work

00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:53.871
and my boss, Dan, came over to me.

00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:55.498
He's like, I'm on the phone right now.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:56.749
And he's like

00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.418
Doug picked you.

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:00.169
And I was like, oh my god.

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:01.045
Oh my god, me?

00:07:01.045 --> 00:07:04.757
Really? Wow! I just couldn't believe it.

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:07.718
I was thinking, I did it. I made it.

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:10.805
>>I felt great for him.

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:12.223
I was really excited.

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:14.016
It was great to learn

00:07:14.016 --> 00:07:15.560
that he was the person selected.

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:19.021
>>He's such a friendly, charismatic type of person.

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:20.231
He's got a good soul.

00:07:23.609 --> 00:07:24.527
>>I was born deaf.

00:07:24.902 --> 00:07:26.612
But I had 20/20 vision.

00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:28.531
I thought about wanting to become an actor.

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:29.532
And meeting actors.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:31.451
And wanting even to be an actor in a movie.

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:37.373
Then at the age of about 30, 31

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:39.000
I started to lose my vision.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:42.253
And it became just so depressing to me.

00:07:42.795 --> 00:07:44.088
I thought there was no way

00:07:44.088 --> 00:07:45.840
that anyone would want to hire someone

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.550
who was not only deaf

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.677
but deaf and blind, to become an actor.

00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:53.389
I have no peripheral vision at all.

00:07:53.764 --> 00:07:55.391
I have like a tiny box of vision

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:57.268
in front of me that I can see through.

00:07:58.436 --> 00:08:00.563
>>So his vision on a great day.

00:08:00.938 --> 00:08:02.690
>>It would be this on top of this.

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:03.691
>>Yeah.

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:06.068
>>I mean, Artie is a completely DeafBlind person

00:08:06.068 --> 00:08:07.278
whereas I am not.

00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:08.946
I'm deaf and legally blind.

00:08:09.113 --> 00:08:11.282
So it was a little bit different for me.

00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:12.992
We're the same but we're not.

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.869
So for me, I was trying to figure out

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:16.287
how to play the part of Artie

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:17.997
because he had no vision.

00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:19.790
I mean, who knows.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.001
In the future I might lose all my vision.

00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:23.961
Just like Artie.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.672
>>I don't know what it's going to be like

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:28.090
getting you guys together.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.092
And actually working through it together.

00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:31.260
>>Do you have any tips to give me

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.136
when I first meet him?

00:08:32.136 --> 00:08:33.137
>>I have a plan

00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:34.138
but also I have no idea.

00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:35.139
We'll have to figure it out.

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:36.599
We'll just see what it's like

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:37.600
when we get moving.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.394
They have pretty unique elevators here.

00:08:40.978 --> 00:08:43.147
There's obviously a lot more buttons in here

00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:44.315
than most elevators.

00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:46.317
And you can keep your hand on the button

00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:50.238
so that when it gets to the floor

00:08:50.238 --> 00:08:51.155
this will pop out

00:08:51.155 --> 00:08:53.449
and it lets you know that you're at your floor.

00:08:56.285 --> 00:08:58.246
I want him to meet Steven.

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:05.711
>>Nice to meet you too.

00:09:06.128 --> 00:09:08.631
>>This is just an opportunity

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.634
for us to be able to get on our feet.

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:14.345
For you and Steven to interact with each other.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:16.889
And for us to start to see where we're at with things.

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:18.891
>>You just gotta go this way, man.

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:20.059
Just, keep walking.

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:22.853
That rehearsal that we did was

00:09:22.853 --> 00:09:24.188
different from any other rehearsal

00:09:24.188 --> 00:09:25.147
that I've done before.

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:27.733
>>I remember, he came over to me.

00:09:27.858 --> 00:09:28.734
He tapped me.

00:09:29.026 --> 00:09:30.945
And he was trying to communicate with me, Tereek.

00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:32.947
And it was the first time.

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:35.658
And he was like trying to guide me.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.369
But here I am, I'm this DeafBlind person

00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:40.788
and we were trying to engage with one another.

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:44.792
>>It took a lot of just trusting each other.

00:09:45.042 --> 00:09:46.961
Listening to each other.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:49.880
>>Even if it's a little awkward for you to do it

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.799
even if you wish you didn't have

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:52.758
as many things in your hands.

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:54.927
That's one of the obstacles

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:56.387
that you still need to get past

00:09:56.387 --> 00:09:57.930
in order to communicate to him.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:01.100
And that first rehearsal was great

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.312
to have Robert and Steven jump right into it.

00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:07.106
But it was also really scary as a director

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:09.650
because I was like, oh man

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.111
I wish we had 20 more rehearsals

00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:13.487
because there's so much more

00:10:13.487 --> 00:10:14.822
we need to get through.

00:10:19.493 --> 00:10:20.119
>>Sorry.

00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:21.370
>>I should have protected you.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.539
>>If I just leave you here

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:24.874
you're not going to be able

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:25.958
to get where you're going.

00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:27.126
>>I have an idea.

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:27.960
>>Yeah.

00:10:29.503 --> 00:10:32.214
So, why don't you be Robert

00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:33.549
and let Tereek be Tereek

00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:34.258
and let him watch you?

00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:35.259
>>Perfect. I love that idea.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.973
>>People, I think, are probably more familiar

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:42.433
with what is called "TASL."

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:44.977
Which is "tactile american sign language."

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:46.854
Which is really just using

00:10:46.854 --> 00:10:48.564
regular visual sign language

00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:49.857
adapted to the hand.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:54.362
>>Haptics is a way of touch communication

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:56.155
that we use here at Helen Keller.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.866
We might have just put our hand

00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:00.451
on Robert's shoulder

00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:03.037
for example to just mean "hold."

00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:04.455
Or just to stop.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.165
>>There are also some people

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:08.292
who might learn the print-on-palm method.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.169
Where you actually take letters

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:12.463
use your index finger and print them

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:14.465
on the other person's palm of their hand.

00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:15.966
>>It was hard for me

00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:17.885
to actually use that type of communication

00:11:17.885 --> 00:11:19.303
because I'm not use to it.

00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:22.765
So it took me a while to understand

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:25.434
what Tereek was trying to communicate to me

00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:26.769
on the palm of my hand.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.898
>>I definitely came away from that first rehearsal

00:11:30.898 --> 00:11:31.857
pretty nervous.

00:11:32.441 --> 00:11:35.027
I was pretty sweaty by the time we got out of there.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:36.862
And looking around at other people

00:11:36.862 --> 00:11:37.863
going, "is it hot in here or is it just me?"

00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:40.032
I know Dan is going to get mad at me

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:42.159
if I don't get you back to the cafeteria.

00:11:46.455 --> 00:11:47.498
>>Ah, dammit.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:48.916
>>It was really great

00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:50.209
to be able to work with the two of them.

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:54.338
Moreover it reaffirmed we had cast the right people.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.173
>>So if you want to cross the street

00:11:56.173 --> 00:11:57.591
say you can see or hear

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.886
this will get you recognized faster.

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:02.304
And then when he's walking

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.307
He just needs to move his cane.

00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:06.892
That's all he needs to do.

00:12:07.309 --> 00:12:09.645
>>You know, basically we're going to be outside

00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:12.356
with some natural light from streetlights

00:12:12.356 --> 00:12:14.817
but also most of the light

00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:15.943
that he's going to feel on him

00:12:15.943 --> 00:12:17.528
is light that we're introducing.

00:12:17.945 --> 00:12:19.613
>>I actually have a lot of concerns with

00:12:19.613 --> 00:12:22.074
what he's going to be able to see from us at night.

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:23.951
>>It was in March of 2018

00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:27.371
that we had that first meeting with HKNC

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.124
but it wasn't until November of that year

00:12:30.124 --> 00:12:31.959
that I got an email

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:34.545
the day before we start shooting the film

00:12:34.545 --> 00:12:36.797
that we found Artemio.

00:12:36.797 --> 00:12:37.965
Or, we know where he lives.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.092
>>One of our former staff members

00:12:40.092 --> 00:12:43.846
had the opportunity to be at a forum

00:12:43.846 --> 00:12:47.391
and at that forum was Artemio.

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:49.810
>>So now it's the day before we start shooting

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.979
and we have this address for Artemio.

00:12:51.979 --> 00:12:54.648
And I was like, invite him to set.

00:12:54.648 --> 00:12:56.108
Let's have him come.

00:12:56.358 --> 00:12:58.569
What better way to let him know what he's inspired

00:12:58.569 --> 00:12:59.862
than have him come down to set.

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:07.286
>>Scene 9, take 2, mark.

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:10.790
>>I remember the first time

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.124
I was standing there on the set

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:13.667
they had to do my makeup

00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:14.668
and I was like, oh

00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:16.712
is that what movie stars do?

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.882
Okay, I'm going to sit in this seat

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:21.008
and get my makeup done.

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:25.805
I'm damn handsome.

00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:29.141
And Doug took me over to a storefront.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:36.982
>>Action.

00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:40.319
>>We were shooting this film in November

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:42.613
in New York City, outside, at night.

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:45.616
So you have the obvious challenges

00:13:45.616 --> 00:13:46.575
that you might assume

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:49.161
of it being quite cold a bunch of the days.

00:13:49.703 --> 00:13:52.164
>>I had to follow what Doug was telling me to do.

00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:53.415
And it was cold.

00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:57.753
And I had to focus on keeping my eyes focused.

00:13:57.753 --> 00:14:00.631
And not act as if I was looking.

00:14:01.131 --> 00:14:02.883
And it was tough with the weather.

00:14:03.884 --> 00:14:06.220
>>You don't need to scan so much.

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:08.055
But, really, yeah.

00:14:09.306 --> 00:14:11.183
>>I'm scanning because I don't know where he is.

00:14:11.308 --> 00:14:13.477
So that was the scan, you know.

00:14:13.477 --> 00:14:14.353
>>Right, sure. Of course.

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:17.356
>>I think it helped to just provide Robert with

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:19.066
a lot of the touch techniques.

00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:21.902
So giving him signals to indicate keep going

00:14:21.902 --> 00:14:25.948
or to indicate the scene was going to cut or to stop

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:27.741
I think really helped out in this situation.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.577
>>He was sticking it out.

00:14:29.743 --> 00:14:31.912
I thought Robert was about to tap out.

00:14:31.912 --> 00:14:32.872
But he was like, naw.

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:34.039
He said, no, I got this.

00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:35.207
I just needed a quick breather.

00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:36.667
And he just got right back up.

00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:39.086
And was like, yeah, we're going to finish this.

00:14:39.086 --> 00:14:40.170
We're going to do this.

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:42.965
When he did that, that just tightened me up.

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:45.509
And I was like, I can get through this too.

00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:51.265
Oh, sorry, man.

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:54.685
>>It doesn't matter if I'm deaf and legally blind.

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:57.354
I still felt like I could do it.

00:14:58.063 --> 00:15:00.691
>>We were shooting almost the whole film

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:01.692
outside at night

00:15:02.109 --> 00:15:03.986
and in those settings

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:06.280
Robert really has little to no vision.

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.199
So something we needed to figure out ahead of time

00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:12.536
how do we break off and create little settings

00:15:12.536 --> 00:15:14.413
where the interpreter's well lit enough

00:15:14.788 --> 00:15:16.790
so that him and Robert can communicate.

00:15:17.541 --> 00:15:19.793
>>So whoever was not actually interpreting

00:15:19.793 --> 00:15:21.253
at the moment would hold the light

00:15:21.795 --> 00:15:23.380
over Robert's shoulder

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.007
so that the light wouldn't distract him.

00:15:25.132 --> 00:15:27.092
So it was coming from behind Robert

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:28.636
so he wouldn't get an ambient glare.

00:15:29.053 --> 00:15:31.013
And he could actually see the interpreter.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:32.264
>>What is that?

00:15:32.848 --> 00:15:34.725
>>It's called a silent call pager.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.560
It's a very simple system.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.145
It's just one-way.

00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:40.522
It either chimes or it vibrates.

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:42.858
So when they're striking the lights

00:15:43.692 --> 00:15:44.735
Robert will wear that.

00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:47.738
>>This is your part.

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:49.823
So I'm just helping you find it.

00:15:50.115 --> 00:15:51.992
But it's your role to have.

00:15:52.242 --> 00:15:54.328
Take more ownership over it.

00:15:54.828 --> 00:15:55.871
>>Okay.

00:15:56.413 --> 00:16:00.000
>>There was a scene where he touches me

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.545
and I kind of shift because of my reflexes.

00:16:03.837 --> 00:16:05.965
And he was saying that in real life

00:16:07.257 --> 00:16:10.594
it's a sad thought that people in this world

00:16:10.594 --> 00:16:14.181
are afraid of human connection.

00:16:14.723 --> 00:16:16.475
>>The point is just communicating.

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:18.185
It doesn't matter how you communicate.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:20.187
Whether it's through sign language

00:16:20.437 --> 00:16:21.605
or with pen and paper.

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:25.609
>>There was a kinship that was building between us.

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:29.071
I believe that it showed on camera.

00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:31.073
There was something just magical

00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:32.866
happening around everyone on set.

00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:34.785
>>Cut.

00:16:36.412 --> 00:16:37.287
That's a wrap.

00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:38.747
>>Whoo!

00:16:38.914 --> 00:16:39.915
>>Shhh!

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:42.918
>>I had to let that out. Sorry.

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:49.174
>>So the shoot comes and goes

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:51.343
and we're not able to get in touch with Artemio.

00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:55.389
A couple days after Christmas of 2018

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:57.224
I was up at HKNC.

00:16:57.224 --> 00:16:59.059
And I was like

00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:00.811
I'm going to just go by his house

00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:02.229
and see what happens.

00:17:03.063 --> 00:17:05.107
We are in front of Artemio's house.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.401
About to knock on his door.

00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:08.819
To our knowledge

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:10.696
he does not know anything about this yet.

00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:12.531
So we're going to go in there

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:14.199
and do our best to explain why we're there

00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:18.328
so that we can finally be reunited with Artemio.

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:21.749
And let him know that he's inspired this film.

00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:23.667
It might have been better

00:17:23.667 --> 00:17:24.960
to do this during the daytime.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.671
Just realizing that.

00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:29.256
But it's dinner time.

00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:30.257
It's, like, an approachable hour.

00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:32.426
>>Hurdle number one.

00:17:34.178 --> 00:17:35.846
>>Definitely don't want to hop the fence.

00:17:36.263 --> 00:17:38.640
That would not be a good start to this operation.

00:17:40.809 --> 00:17:42.936
By any chance you've ever seen anyone...

00:17:42.936 --> 00:17:45.272
if they have a son that's deaf and blind?

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.067
>>I think they do have, yeah they do.

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:48.984
>>Okay, they do?

00:17:49.234 --> 00:17:50.277
>>They always lock their gate

00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:51.779
so usually you have to yell out.

00:17:51.904 --> 00:17:52.571
>>Hello!

00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:53.864
Hello!

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:56.283
I have a question.

00:17:56.366 --> 00:17:57.076
>>Hello.

00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:58.994
>>Is Artemio your son?

00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:00.829
>>Artemio?   - Yeah.

00:18:00.954 --> 00:18:01.538
>>Si.

00:18:01.663 --> 00:18:02.164
>>Okay.

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:04.583
So we're friends of the Helen Keller National Center.

00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:06.627
>>One moment.   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.295
>>Come on.   - Okay.

00:18:08.378 --> 00:18:10.422
>>He's coming.   - Oh, great.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.219
>>Sorry, I am hungry.

00:18:15.344 --> 00:18:16.720
>>No, please.

00:18:17.137 --> 00:18:18.180
Please.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:21.767
>>My husband.

00:18:23.894 --> 00:18:25.771
>>What did Artemio say

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.439
when you explained

00:18:27.439 --> 00:18:29.691
who we are and why we're here?

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:35.823
[Spanish translation]

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:45.582
>>[in Spanish]

00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:48.127
I told him a seven year old friend

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:49.628
is here and wants to see him.

00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:27.791
He remembers. You remember?

00:19:28.584 --> 00:19:30.460
>>Very quickly we realized

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:34.006
that the most effecient way for us to communicate

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:35.549
was just like how we communicated

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:36.633
when we first met each other.

00:19:37.968 --> 00:19:39.344
>>Are you an artist?

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.265
Yes. Filmmaker.

00:19:43.807 --> 00:19:48.478
>>Do you want a fresh water?

00:19:48.729 --> 00:19:49.897
Sure.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.273
It had been at this point

00:19:51.273 --> 00:19:53.483
about seven and a half years exactly

00:19:53.483 --> 00:19:55.527
since the one and only time

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:56.486
that I had met him prior.

00:19:56.945 --> 00:19:58.697
But the instant he walked down the stairs

00:19:59.072 --> 00:20:00.699
his appearance and his energy

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:01.825
it was very familiar.

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:03.660
Surprisingly so.

00:20:05.245 --> 00:20:06.705
Over the course of this year

00:20:06.705 --> 00:20:08.081
in searching for him

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:11.084
I started building this rounded understanding

00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:12.544
of who Artemio was

00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:14.838
through all these other encounters that he'd had

00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:15.589
with other people.

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:21.511
I will tell you

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:26.016
more about the film

00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:31.563
soon.

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:34.316
It was great to be able to finally fill him in

00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:37.569
on this whole experience that he's inspired.

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:39.029
But it was really just, more than anything

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:40.405
really great to see him again.

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:45.619
It was such a pleasure

00:20:46.787 --> 00:20:53.585
to meet you again.

00:21:03.303 --> 00:21:06.473
So great

00:21:06.473 --> 00:21:10.477
to see you again.

00:21:12.479 --> 00:21:14.898
>>Doug had never even met a DeafBlind person

00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:16.608
in his entire life.

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:19.486
Meeting me was his first time

00:21:19.486 --> 00:21:21.363
encountering a DeafBlind individual.

00:21:22.114 --> 00:21:24.032
And we ultimately became friends.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.702
Now I'm motivated

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:28.495
to learn about becoming an actor.

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:31.873
And becoming an author.

00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:34.251
Similar to Helen Keller.

00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:37.796
>>Robert being a part of this experience

00:21:38.213 --> 00:21:39.381
wasn't a challenge.

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:40.716
It made it what it is.

00:21:41.174 --> 00:21:43.218
It was such an integral part

00:21:43.218 --> 00:21:45.012
of creating the environment

00:21:45.178 --> 00:21:47.889
that pervaded every moment of the shoot.

00:21:48.181 --> 00:21:49.808
It's in the DNA of every moment

00:21:49.808 --> 00:21:50.934
of the story that we're telling.

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:54.563
>>It gives other individuals who are DeafBlind

00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:56.398
an example of what's possible.

00:21:57.607 --> 00:21:59.818
>>It was a learning and humbling experience.

00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:01.445
All around.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.197
>>I can do anything.

00:22:05.324 --> 00:22:08.285
Just like your typical sighted-person can do.

00:22:08.702 --> 00:22:10.787
>>It doesn't really matter who the people are.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:12.873
It's about that connection

00:22:13.081 --> 00:22:14.333
that two people can make.

00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:17.127
>>I hope to educate people through the film.

00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:18.754
So that's my hope for the future.

00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:21.256
And I hope that Doug, maybe, who knows

00:22:21.256 --> 00:22:23.592
he'll give me a shot at doing part two of this movie.

00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:26.386
>>The whole journey from the start

00:22:26.386 --> 00:22:29.139
of meeting Artemio years ago

00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:32.476
to aligning with Helen Keller National Center

00:22:32.809 --> 00:22:37.814
to casting Robert as our DeafBlind actor in the film

00:22:38.398 --> 00:22:39.983
has been such an amazing journey.

00:22:39.983 --> 00:22:42.819
And it was just so great to have it capped off

00:22:42.819 --> 00:22:44.237
by reuniting with Artie.

00:22:44.237 --> 00:22:45.947
And getting a chance to share that with him.

00:22:46.531 --> 00:22:51.078
>>To really elevate people's awareness

00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:53.997
about people who are DeafBlind is tremendous.

00:22:55.707 --> 00:22:57.125
>>I feel like at the end

00:22:57.125 --> 00:22:59.086
when we embrace each other and have the hug

00:23:01.963 --> 00:23:03.173
I feel like it was showing

00:23:03.173 --> 00:23:04.841
how people can help each other out.

00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:08.095
And I felt like that was something

00:23:08.095 --> 00:23:09.763
that really left an impact on me.

00:23:10.305 --> 00:23:12.849
Because we are all not alone in this world.

00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:15.394
Everybody needs each other.

00:23:15.936 --> 00:23:17.562
Everybody needs help.

00:23:17.729 --> 00:23:20.357
And everybody can help each other out.
