00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.875
Brian: Imagine you can't see

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:10.250
you’re wearing a blindfold
and part of your hearing is gone.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.625
Carl: Okay, forward

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:14.125
Brian: All of a sudden
you have to trust the dog.

00:00:14.125 --> 00:00:17.125
It’s pulling you, it’s literally
pulling you forward

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:22.125
and you have to 100% trust that the dog
is not gonna run you into a wall.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.250
And believe it or not, they probably
will run you into a wall once or twice.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.791
Carl: I do consider the cane
to be an incredibly valued tool.

00:00:38.791 --> 00:00:42.375
A cane is more reactive and more tactile.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.750
You can feel where the curb is,
you can feel where the hydrant is

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.250
if you’re just sweeping your cane.
You can feel for the door.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.000
Where if my dog's doing its job,

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:56.250
I’m avoiding the curb, I'm avoiding the
fire hydrant, I'm avoiding the door.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.250
Korrine: With a cane, constantly your cane gets
stuck in cracks in the sidewalk

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.250
and gets stuck on certain obstacles.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.000
Whereas the guide dog just glides around
stuff more effortlessly.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.125
Carl: The dog is also
a second set of eyes and ears.

00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:12.750
I'm also hard of hearing
as well as visually impaired,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.250
if I feel his head move,
I know something's up.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.375
So I just prefer the use of a guide dog.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.375
I just feel more confident

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:26.250
in how I move, and when things
are clicking, and I mean clicking

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.000
like when you're moving down a street
and you're hitting the destination

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.000
and all cylinders are just moving,
there's no better feeling.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.875
It’s as close to walking
independently without a cane,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.791
it’s as close to that
experience as you can get.

00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:42.750
[music plays]

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:48.125
Kerry: It was not an easy journey.

00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:51.125
I think for those who are DeafBlind
who would like a guide dog,

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:54.125
I think the process takes
a little bit longer

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:58.750
especially if there's some hesitation
for some guide dog school

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.916
to even work
with people who are DeafBlind,

00:02:01.916 --> 00:02:05.375
which means like an
extra layer of training for

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.125
a person who can hear but not see

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:12.000
would be able to listen
to their environment and tell

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:15.250
when it’s safe for the dog
and then to go forward.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.750
But a person who is deaf and blind

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.500
can't rely on their hearing to understand
what's happening in the environment.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.250
So there's a little bit more training
that goes with it.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.500
Korrine: There are programs
where they come to your hometown

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.375
and you train in your hometown,
and then there's campus programs

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:36.291
where you go to their campus and work
and you live in a dorm like at college.

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:38.375
So there's different experiences.

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:40.500
People need to kind of take that
into consideration.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.750
It's not a pet. It's
not just a regular dog.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.250
They're held to really high standards
to keep us safe and they have a job to do.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.250
Kerry: Getting the first guide
dog usually happens within a year.

00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:53.750
There is so much to learn

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.541
in this journey of being
a handler of a guide dog.

00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:03.500
I think no matter how much you ask
people who have guide dogs

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.250
or read books about guide dogs,

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.500
no amount of preparing
really ever prepares you for it.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.750
[music plays]

00:03:15.916 --> 00:03:19.875
Brian: The first couple of months
are easily the roughest ones.

00:03:19.875 --> 00:03:23.500
Working together
is definitely a challenge.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.625
Each one personality wise
is different and unique.

00:03:27.625 --> 00:03:31.500
And the way you work together
is gonna be different.

00:03:31.875 --> 00:03:34.250
Carl: At first it’s hard.
When you get your first dog

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.875
it takes a long time to learn
to put your trust in a dog.

00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:41.291
And it takes about a year,

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:43.750
maybe longer,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.666
to the point when you're willing
to put your life in their hands.

00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:51.000
But when you hit that
and they also trust you

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.125
that you're not going to put them in harm,
it's just an incredible feeling.

00:03:56.125 --> 00:03:59.125
I can't explain it, it’s hard
to explain to people who haven't

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.250
had that bond with guide dogs.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.875
But it's an unusual bond
because I'm depending on my dog

00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:06.750
to potentially save my life.

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:09.875
Linda: My dog saved my life.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.750
Yeah, I was walking across the street,

00:04:13.916 --> 00:04:18.250
I had the light, I was in the crosswalk
and I was walking across the street

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.125
and I got to the middle of the street
and he stopped.

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:23.250
And I'm going, “Forward. Forward.”
I’m saying, “Oh, God.”

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.125
And you hear the trainer say,
“Listen to your dog.

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:29.750
Because if you don't listen to your dog,
you're going to get hurt.”

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.250
So I'm standing still. And then
some woman screams, “Oh my God.”

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.375
And I'm like, “Oh, this is going to hurt.”

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:40.500
So I stood still and something went

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.000
[whoosh sound]

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.250
past my nose.

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:45.625
And apparently
when I got to the other side

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:48.375
they said it was a
big black SUV or something.

00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:52.000
If I had my cane and I kept going,
I wouldn't be here talking to you

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.500
right now because he would
have killed me. He was flying.

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:57.625
But we walked to
he other side, kept going.

00:04:58.375 --> 00:05:02.000
And, you know, that's what
these dogs are trained to do.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.375
They guide you, they become part of you.

00:05:04.375 --> 00:05:08.416
They give you self-esteem,
independence, confidence.

00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:11.000
And you become a whole.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.750
Yeah, you become whole.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.250
Korrine: It just, my comfort level.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.625
I feel like I'm able
to do so much more.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.625
And it's also a really good icebreaker

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:24.625
for having a conversation
and getting to talk to people.

00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:28.250
When you have a dog, at least it kind of
eases the conversation a little bit.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.250
They’re like, “Oh, it's so cute.”

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.875
Or you know, it just lightens it up.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.875
Carl: It's just an unbelievable feeling.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:36.500
And the dogs even
take pride in their work.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.500
When they do something right, they'll
look at you like, “I did that right, didn’t I?

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.125
Yeah, tell me I'm a good boy.”

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:43.166
you know
[laughter]

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:45.250
And I’m like, “Ok, you’re a good boy.”

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.250
And then they'll take a
ponce in their step, and you know...

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:50.916
it's just an amazing feeling.

00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:55.125
[music plays]

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.500
David: Orientation and mobility
is really just a foundational skill.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.000
It goes to the heart of independence
and self-determination.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.125
If you can get around on your own.

00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:11.750
well, you're much more inclined to be more
independent, more self-determined.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.541
Many of these streets
seemingly are irrational, but, you know,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.625
the reason why the street may curve

00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:22.750
is because back in the 1700s
there was a big oak tree in the way

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.625
so they just kind of meandered around it.

00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:26.625
And, you know,
now that the oak tree is gone,

00:06:26.625 --> 00:06:29.250
everybody wonders,
why is there that meander in the road?

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.625
But many of these streets were designed
for horse and buggy and not necessarily

00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:37.541
power chairs or people using
a cane or a guide dog.

00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:41.625
I think older cities tend
to have those idiosyncrasies, which

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:50.500
for people who don't have a disability
are maybe quaint and cool and attractive.

00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:54.250
But for people who do have a disability,
they can be real barriers.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.250
You know, places without truncated
domes are more dangerous than places

00:06:58.625 --> 00:07:00.375
that do have truncated domes.

00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:02.625
Places that have good audible

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:07.750
signalization at intersections so you can
cross are safer than places that don't.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.875
I think things are better.

00:07:09.875 --> 00:07:13.750
There's still a large way to go
though, in terms of curb cuts

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.125
and signalization and all the things
that we can do to improve access

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.000
for people with disabilities.
