00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.625
Rebecca: So many people with disabilities

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:08.666
are so aware of the fact
that their disability

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:10.250
makes other people uncomfortable

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.750
that they adjust themselves.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.500
They need to be funny.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.041
They need to be likable.

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:17.791
They need to disarm themselves.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.083
They need to show the world,
“hey, I'm just like you.”

00:00:22.083 --> 00:00:25.375

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.500
Fatou: You know what is the
hardest part of it all?

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:37.125
Is having friends that do not get it.

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:40.375
They don't get what it means
to be DeafBlind or have Usher syndrome.

00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:41.375
They just don't.

00:00:42.083 --> 00:00:44.625
Even after you've educated
them, it's not getting through.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.750
And that's a choice
they've made not to get it.

00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:50.416
Korrine: The stigma.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:52.875
When you hear somebody

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:56.666
say something about
blindness or hearing loss.

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:59.125
What you see in movies

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:02.541
and books and everything.

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:04.291
People get the wrong idea.

00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:07.000
There really needs to be more
awareness and more education

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.250
because I think people are really scared.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.250
I don't know what they're scared of,
but, you know,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.541
I think it's just a learning
curve for everybody,

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:18.375
that everyone kind of needs
to learn about these things

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:22.875
and try to understand it and look at it
from a different perspective.

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:27.750
Rebecca: The biggest issue that people have
unconsciously, subconsciously,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.291
with seeing people with disabilities

00:01:30.416 --> 00:01:34.041
is that it brings up in them
their own morbidity and mortality.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.625
It brings up in them all of
the things that they're afraid

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:44.083
will happen to them or that
they will no longer be able to do.

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:48.291
There's a sign in sign language
that's like, “I pity you or I'm so sorry.”

00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:52.250
And this is how people oftentimes
think of people with disabilities.

00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:54.750
Fatou: Again, we're conditioned. We learn that.

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:57.291
Communicating with people
can be very difficult.

00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:00.125
Sometimes it's just not happening.

00:02:00.583 --> 00:02:02.375
So I have to be extra patient,

00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:06.125
ask for clarification so that I can
understand what's happening.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:09.833
Sometimes people still
don’t understand that DeafBlind people,

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.666
even after explaining everything to them.

00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:13.500
Look at how we behave.

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:15.291
See if we truly understand.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.791
And it's difficult managing that
with people that ain't got no sense.

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:23.250
Alice: It isn't easy sometimes,
like going shopping and having them

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.125
pretend you're not using an iPad
or a communication device

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:31.000
or communication cards and they just
look at you like you came from space.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.000
That's not going to help much.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.625
Yes, I'm a blind person, but that's
a characteristic, it's not who I am.

00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:41.500
If you look at us
and think it's impossible,

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.875
then you already built your own wall.

00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:45.000
We welcome you.

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:48.291
It would be nice to be welcomed
on the opposite side.

00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:51.125
[music plays]

00:02:54.666 --> 00:02:57.500
Fatou: I have seen and come across
a lot of DeafBlind people,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.000
my sister included, who feel embarrassed

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.625
and timid and conceal their DeafBlindness

00:03:02.625 --> 00:03:05.375
because the thought of others
knowing about their DeafBlindness

00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:06.916
makes them feel some type of way.

00:03:06.916 --> 00:03:10.875
Korrine: There are ways to cope,
and I think one thing

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:14.250
that really helped was getting
a therapist, talking to a therapist.

00:03:14.541 --> 00:03:15.750
I'm not ashamed to say that.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.250
I think that that was really helpful
to have an outlet to go to,

00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:23.125
aside from like a family member
or a friend or the other network is just

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:27.166
like an outside perspective of like,
“hey, here's everything that's going on,

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:28.250
give me some advice.’

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.375
Alice: Finding a therapist,
that's a serious adventure.

00:03:31.708 --> 00:03:35.000
Finding one that can even deal
with what species you are.

00:03:35.541 --> 00:03:36.875
It's kind of like training.

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:40.875
Literally just like I break in
a new best friend, sort of.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.791
And this is how it works and this is,
you know, when you're hanging with me,

00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:50.500
this is the stuff that happens and
you got to kind of school them

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.416
so that they know this is your life
and this is how it works.

00:03:54.416 --> 00:03:56.000
And no, you can't just

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.125
start prattle, prattle, prattle
because it's not going to work that way.

00:03:59.541 --> 00:04:00.500
Korrine: That's the exhaustion.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.500
That's why people with
disability oftentimes,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.625
when they seek mental health, they don't
get the mental care that they need

00:04:05.791 --> 00:04:09.250
because they're spending so much time
with people who have preconceived ideas

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.125
who don't understand what it's like
to live as a DeafBlind person.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.250
So I think there's just a lot of
education that goes into it,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.625
that disrupts or interferes
with our ability as people

00:04:22.625 --> 00:04:25.875
with DeafBlindness to just get the
support and the help that we need.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.166
But it's also so important
for us to be able

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.250
to create more therapists and more
people who are mental health oriented

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.125
within our own community so
that we can help each other.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.750
Korrine: Being able to connect with people
who are kind of in my shoes,

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.750
who understood what I was going through
and I really gained a lot more confidence

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.500
after getting connected with all
these groups and all these people

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.291
and be able to be a voice
for people who can't

00:04:54.291 --> 00:04:56.000
Rebecca: We're so afraid to ask for help.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We're so afraid to speak our needs.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.375
But when you ask for help,
you engender in someone

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.750
the feeling that they're needed
and that they matter

00:05:06.125 --> 00:05:10.416
and I don't think anybody wants
anything more in this world

00:05:10.416 --> 00:05:13.416
than to feel like they're needed
or that they matter.

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:17.166
And so if you can see it more
from what you offer

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:20.875
someone else when you ask for help,
you're not asking them to do it for you.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.000
You're asking for their support.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.875
Then maybe that will start to shift
the way that people with disabilities

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:30.000
see themselves when they
ask for help from others.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.875
The most productive and successful

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.041
and cohabitative communities

00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:35.875
and cohabitative communities

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.875
are interdependent, not independent.

00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:45.916
It's where we all rely on each other
to be able to ensure the success

00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:48.500
and the ability for people to thrive

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.750
in the area that we live in.

00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:54.791
