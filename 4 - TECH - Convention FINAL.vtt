00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.875
Brian: Assistive technology,
that allowed me to be able

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:10.541
to navigate and use the Match app
that eventually led me to meeting my wife.

00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:13.416
I have a lot to thank for,
for assistive technology.

00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:16.125
[music plays]

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.041
Brian: So I use assistive technology
all day, every day.

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:26.000
And it can be, you know,
any kind of tool that

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:31.166
assists someone with a disability
to accomplish everyday tasks.

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.791
So those include things like

00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.500
my mobility cane, my guide dog.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.375
I wear a pair of hearing aids.

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:41.500
Alice: I use lots of things for daily life access.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.791
My iPhone, my iPad, my braille display.

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:49.416
I'm using the iPad with Otter.ai,

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.916
which is internet-based speech-to-text,

00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:55.375
and the text is modifiable.

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:56.583
I can enlarge it,

00:00:56.583 --> 00:00:59.625
I can shift it,
I can rotate it left to right.

00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:01.875
It's literally typing

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:05.875
in everything
that's said by you and by me.

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:10.375
Lydia: The way I access
things digitally is through

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.750
screen reading software and a braille display.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.375
Rocky: Braille is paramount.

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:22.416
It's an entire code that was
designed for individuals who are blind.

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:24.500
And there are a number
of different devices out there.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.916
I mean, there's all kinds
of different braille displays.

00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:29.416
I got to see a bunch of them
last week at the expo.

00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:32.208
Different companies came to display
their different wares essentially.

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:34.291
So there's different devices that can do

00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:36.500
a number of spectacular things.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.000
Man: The MyEye has the ability
to recognize things because once you store,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.125
the things are on the device.

00:01:43.125 --> 00:01:46.541
Brian: Most people think of it
as a really narrow thing,

00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:49.500
you know, it’s a screen reader
or braille display,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.125
but it can be almost anything
that assists someone with a disability.

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:58.291
Alice: For instance, this piece in the middle of
my chest, it controls the volume.

00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:02.125
It can change the channels
on one of my processors on the left.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.541
My iPhone carries the app
that coordinates all of the channels

00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:11.041
and volume and modifications
on my right processor.

00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:15.833
The stuff that attaches to
my cochlear implant can be immense.

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:18.875
Rocky: One of my favorite ones
it was a DeafBlind-style communicator

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:21.625
where I can type a message in braille and

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:22.750
you could read it in print

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.541
and type a message back to me

00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:25.625
and I could read it in braille

00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:27.916
and we could actually
correspond in that manner.

00:02:27.916 --> 00:02:29.916
And a lot of DeafBlind people do that.

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:39.875
Adriana: She’s like, “My jaw is on the floor, wow.”

00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:42.000
[laughter]

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:45.375
Brian: You know, there's a lot
of applications out there

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:48.000
now for people who are blind
and visually impaired.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.875
There’s a lot of tools that allow you

00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:52.500
to identify things in your environment.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.875
There’s OCR scanners that can read print

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:59.416
and, you know, we do adapt
a lot of things around the house.

00:02:59.416 --> 00:03:04.500
Our microwave and our laundry
machine had tactile buttons on it.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.625
Rocky: I know there used to be a time
when even people who are blind had to use

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:12.250
live readers and actually hire people
to read things for them. And

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.166
with things, everything going

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:16.291
paperless and with more technology available,

00:03:17.541 --> 00:03:20.875
the need for readers
is extraordinarily rare

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:24.250
in my case. I can do a lot of things
independently, and I think it's really

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.291
empowered, DeafBlind people
to really be able to function.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.916
Lydia: A lot of people perceive us

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:35.250
as sometimes being incapable
of doing certain things

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.916
or just not realizing our
full potential and our abilities

00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:45.250
And I think what people should understand
is that even though we do have

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.750
some sensory impairments, with the correct
access tools and accommodations,

00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:54.125
we can perform all of the same tasks as

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:57.625
someone who does not have sight

00:03:57.625 --> 00:03:58.875
or hearing impairments.

00:03:59.083 --> 00:04:00.625
Woman: So it's like a CCTV?

00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:05.125
Man: Yes. So step 1
every CCTV should make things bigger

00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:09.000
and should make things brighter and
should make things change color.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.125
Brian: There's a lot of work being done

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:16.000
around artificial intelligence
and around vision.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.166
And so I think a lot of those tools
are going to become more and more useful.

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:25.291
And so I think the future is really

00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:26.291
integrating a lot of
the technology that exists.

00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:28.416
Rocky: There’s a lot of moving parts that go into this

00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:33.291
technology and yet we're able
to evolve it to a point where

00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:36.291
I can just do most things independently

00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:38.666
and I am very, very appreciative of that.

00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:41.625
Alice: It’s just thinking a little bit out of the box.

00:04:42.416 --> 00:04:45.333
