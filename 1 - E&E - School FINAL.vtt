00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:05.666
Bien: When I look back on my life,

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.000
thinking about how and where I grew up,

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.625
I didn't know anything.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.125
In terms of my education, you know.

00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:15.000
I didn't go to school because I was deaf.

00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:18.291
So there was no education
for people who were deaf

00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:20.875
in the Dominican Republic,
or at least not for me.

00:00:21.416 --> 00:00:24.500
So I went through my life not really
having a way to communicate.

00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:30.791
[music plays]

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:39.291
Rosanna: A person who is born blind,
visually impaired or DeafBlind

00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:42.625
is born into a very different situation

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:44.000
than their average counterpart.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.791
They have to learn skills
that are very, very different

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.916
in order to compete with their counterpart
in the sighted world.

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:59.375
Thinking back in my own life,
my parents really did not know what to do

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:01.416
or how to really work with a child

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:05.291
that was blind, and they were
kind of at a total loss.

00:01:05.541 --> 00:01:09.458
Like, “okay, where is this child going to fit in?”

00:01:09.458 --> 00:01:11.750
The doctors told
them that I was going to be

00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:17.541
what they call an “LD child” at
that time, “learning lisabled.”

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.250
My mom really was very strong

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.500
and did not believe that the doctor

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.500
or psychiatrist at that
time was right about that.

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:30.625
And so she spent a lot of time
doing puzzles

00:01:30.625 --> 00:01:35.250
with me and educational toys
to develop my brain.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.125
I went on to nursery school
where my mom worked, by the way,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.375
just so that I could be in nursery school
and be in an educational environment.

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:47.500
Bien: I was taken from my grandparents
to the Virgin Islands

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.750
to an island of Saint Croix
where I was put in school.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.791
I mean, I'm saying this now.

00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:54.125
I don't know what that meant.

00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:55.875
It was a school for the deaf.

00:01:55.875 --> 00:01:56.875
I was embarrassed.

00:01:56.875 --> 00:02:01.375
I didn't know sign language, which is what
these folks were doing around me.

00:02:01.791 --> 00:02:03.625
I didn't know how to answer questions.

00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:06.750
And the teachers really tried
to convey information to me,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.041
but it was really, really difficult.

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:13.500
I tried to learn words, quote unquote,
like the alphabet, and they would

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.791
show me pictures of the letter A
and then show me that in sign language.

00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:21.125
But when I finally connected
what they were trying to do,

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.541
it was like a fire was lit inside of me.

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:28.916
I thought I was disabled, like I thought
really I had a developmental disability,

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:31.500
you know, at that time they called it
mental retardation.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.916
And I didn't know what was going on.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.000
But when they gave me this
visual language, this way to communicate,

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:40.250
I was like, “okay, bring it on.”

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:45.000
I guess I was like nine or ten years old
that I finally made the connection.

00:02:45.416 --> 00:02:46.541
Learning began.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.500
I had classes like
everybody else, math and gym

00:02:50.875 --> 00:02:54.625
And with all of those classes,
so did my sign language expand.

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:57.791
So I really tried
to look forward, not back.

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.500
[music plays]

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.125
Bien: My mom then told me that I had
to go to New York, and I was like,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.000
“Mommy are you sure?” and she convinced
me that this was the right thing for me.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.375
So she bought the plane ticket
and I'm not going to lie, I cried.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.500
But I got on the plane
and I flew to New York

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.500
and they put me in the Lexington School
for the Deaf.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.541
Rosanna: I went on to public school.

00:03:26.541 --> 00:03:31.750
It was only myself and one other girl
that was in the public school system

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.375
who were at that time
considered legally blind.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.916
So I then began the challenge

00:03:38.916 --> 00:03:42.375
of advocating for myself, of growing up.

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:46.125
I wanted to be like everybody else,
and that was my goal.

00:03:46.375 --> 00:03:48.416
I wanted to be like my sighted friends.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.000
I wanted to do what everybody else did.

00:03:51.291 --> 00:03:54.291
I didn't want to be treated differently.

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:57.375
Bien: I'm not going to lie. It was hard.

00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:01.625
But once I got it,
I really felt like I could fit in here!

00:04:03.125 --> 00:04:04.583
I remember meeting the principal

00:04:04.583 --> 00:04:09.250
and introducing myself and saying,
“Hi, my name is Bienvenido Batista.

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:11.041
Yeah, it's nice to meet you.”

00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:14.125
And just sort of
taking everything in visually.

00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:15.875
Everybody there was a signer.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.000
And so my language grew there.

00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:19.875
And I stayed there.

00:04:20.541 --> 00:04:22.375
And I learned so much.

00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:25.375
And, you know,
I just was where I belonged.

00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:28.041
And I was with people
that I could be with.

00:04:28.375 --> 00:04:31.625
And then I came to the
Helen Keller National Center

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:35.375
and coming here, man,
sent shivers up my spine.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I felt like this is where I needed to be.

00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:41.000
I’m like, oh, this
is what a cane does?

00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:43.250
And this is what Braille is like?

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.750
Let’s go, bring it on. Come on.

00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:48.750
I want to learn everything
that I need to learn.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.125
And I was excited to do so.

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:56.375
Rosanna: When I was in high school getting ready
to go to college, I had a state counselor

00:04:57.375 --> 00:05:00.250
who honestly did not believe in me.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.125
“I don't think you're college material and
I don't think you should go to college.

00:05:05.375 --> 00:05:07.916
You might want to pursue

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:11.250
another avenue in your life.”
So he honestly

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.750
did not believe in me and like,
“no, you're not going to go to college.”

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.625
I went on, did very well in college.

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:21.250
You know, I graduated with a 3.5,

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:24.125
then decided to go on to graduate school.

00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:26.333
They said, “really?

00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:29.375
You really want to go to graduate school?”
Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:32.916
I did some work in the area of theology

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:36.125
at Saint John's University
for a couple of years.

00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:39.291
Completed that, when on, later on

00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:42.375
after I started working at JPMorgan Chase,

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:46.541
I decided to go back
to school again in 2008

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.250
and went on and did my MBA concentrating
in human resource management.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.291
So I kind of not only surpassed the

00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:01.666
stereotype that, Oh no,

00:06:01.666 --> 00:06:05.666
you’re not college material to proving that,

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.375
Hey, I'm going to do this.

00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:11.291
If you really want something
and you desire

00:06:11.291 --> 00:06:14.375
something, you're going to
reach that goal.

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:17.125
But you really have to want it.

00:06:17.125 --> 00:06:20.375
And if you really want it,
you can achieve it.

00:06:20.625 --> 00:06:23.541
If there's any message
that I would send out

00:06:23.791 --> 00:06:27.750
to the blind or DeafBlind community,
that is the message

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.375
that I would give.

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:32.583
