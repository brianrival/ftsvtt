Renee: It took all day.

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.541
It was an extensive amount of tests
they took from me.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:11.000
They had to dilate my eyes,
take pictures of them,

00:00:11.125 --> 00:00:14.250
and they went through all these tests,
just one after the other,

00:00:14.416 --> 00:00:16.125
and then they just kept adding more.

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:20.625
So finally, at the end of it, the doctor
came up to me very solemnly and said

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.416
You have RP,
which is Retina Pigmentosa.

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:27.416
And they said,
you're going to become blind

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.166
and there's no cure for this.

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.916

00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:41.500
Anne: My brother was on a first name
basis with the tire guy.

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:44.166
He was always getting into little car

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.250
crashes.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.958
Carl: Deaf people don't
consider hearing loss

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.791
a disability, it’s just who they are.

00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:54.916
When I started losing my sight,
I was in denial.

00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:56.916
I didn't use my cane.

00:00:56.916 --> 00:00:58.375
Anne: My parents took him in.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:02.625
and then as soon as that happened
and he got diagnosed,

00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:04.000
they kind of knew about me.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.875
My mother was watching me one night
and I was at my grandparents’ house

00:01:07.875 --> 00:01:11.916
and I was going down the stairs
in the dark, and I was shuffling

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:15.000
with my feet to feel where I was going.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.250
My parents were like, “Shhh...”

00:01:17.875 --> 00:01:19.250
you know, and they knew.

00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:22.166
Then they took us in
for more testing at Mass Eye and Ear

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.875
and sure enough, we had Usher syndrome.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.291
Carl: I became legally blind
and I still had 20/20 vision,

00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:30.250
so I thought I was fooling people.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.791
But later I learned, like when I would go
into a store, a convenience store,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.125
and I would get my change they'd go, “Here
you go.” And I still just stand there.

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:40.750
And they are like, “Oh, he's stupid.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.375
He's on drugs.’ No, what it was,
I wasn't seeing the action of the hand

00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:49.541
being put out to give me the change
because it was below my peripheral vision.

00:01:50.125 --> 00:01:55.000
Rebecca: Recently, some friends and I went
to hear this band at The Cutting Room

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and so I'm sitting here
waiting for them to come on.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.916
And then all of a sudden
the band comes on and turns out

00:01:59.916 --> 00:02:02.125
they’re over here, and I'm like,
oh, right. Okay.

00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:03.375
So I turn around, you know,

00:02:03.375 --> 00:02:06.625
and just sort of have to
orient myself to the space.

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:08.875
And then I'm hearing the band now

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:12.500
because I have cochlear implants.
I’m really taking it in and loving it.

00:02:12.875 --> 00:02:15.000
And we order food and the food comes

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.166
and I realize I can't see my food.

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:20.416
I'm able to hear
because I have cochlear implants.

00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:23.500
And I'm so appreciative
for being able to have this experience

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:29.416
and also mourning this experience of like,
‘Wow, I'm now here where I have to learn

00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:33.166
how to eat without being able to see.”
And that's the emotion.

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:34.666
Like, that's

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:39.250
just that whole confluence
of all of these things happening at once.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.375
And that I think

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:44.583
is the best way that I can depict
what it feels like to go DeafBlind,

00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:49.125
because you can be at once
totally appreciative and able

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.041
and also so sad and grieving and knowing

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.625
which emotion to sit with
at one time is so difficult.

00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:03.125
[music plays]

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.125
Carl: When I was about 24 or 25,
I went to the audiologist and said,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.666
“I need more powerful hearing aids.

00:03:14.666 --> 00:03:16.125
My hearing is getting worse.”

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:19.833
She did the test, said,
“No, your hearing loss has not gotten worse.”

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:22.500
I'm like “Yes it is!” And we did it again.

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:24.791
What we didn't know is
if my vision was getting worse.

00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.916
I was loosing the ability to read lips.

00:03:26.916 --> 00:03:29.916
I wasn't even aware
of what a good lip reader I was.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.375
I just thought I was hearing them.

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:36.625
Elaine: Throughout my life I had
many deaf friends. I went to a deaf school.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.375
I have many friends who I love.
I have no complaints.

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:43.125
It wasn’t until I went to Washington D.C.

00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:45.250
that I realized that my life would be different.

00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:48.875
And I couldn’t believe it.
I refused to believe it.

00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:52.375
And little by little, I learned more
about Usher syndrome

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:54.625
and how it would affect my vision

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:57.125
and gradually caused me
to lose my eyesight.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.500
Rebecca: If you're deaf, you rely
very heavily on your sight.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.750
When you sign, that's
how you listen to someone.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.375
You know, this is ‘listen’
and this is ‘listen’ when You're deaf.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.500
Your sight is how you process
and take in the world.

00:04:12.875 --> 00:04:14.916
But when you're losing your vision

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:17.958
and you don't have hearing,
how do you process and take in the world?

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:22.000
Kerry: If you ask a doctor,
what does my future look like?

00:04:22.375 --> 00:04:23.875
When will I go completely blind?

00:04:23.875 --> 00:04:27.291
Or what will happen in my twenties
and my thirties and forties?

00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:30.875
And a doctor will say,
“I can't answer that.

00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:34.000
It's so different for each person.”

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.791
And over time, you know,
you still don't know.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.500
What should you learn?

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.416
What should you do if you don't know
what your future is like?

00:04:43.416 --> 00:04:45.041
Anne: You do have to adapt.

00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:48.375
Like right now,
I can still do some large print,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.666
but it can't be too large

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:54.375
because I have such a small
little bubble where I can see.

00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:58.791
Eventually I'm
going to have to learn speech or Braille

00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:02.041
because I'm not going to be able
to do the visual cues

00:05:02.041 --> 00:05:04.125
and I'm not going to be able
to hear as well,

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:05.666
chances are

00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:09.916
So I probably will have to use some tactile
sign, even if it's just basic.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.666
You know, I don't think my family's
going to be fluent in sign language,

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:15.916
but, you know,
maybe they can learn the alphabet.

00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:16.750
(laughs)

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.750
Carl: To a blind person.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.750
If they go deaf,

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:24.125
then reading audiobooks
and listening to music,

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.375
and how they gather information
and how they echolocate

00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:30.000
to align themselves with traffic, is gone.

00:05:30.375 --> 00:05:35.541
To a deaf person, how you communicate
with the beautiful visual sign language.

00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:38.875
DeafBlind people put both blind people

00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:43.708
and deaf people in a conundrum
because we, as DeafBlind people,

00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:46.125
have both things
which neither one of them want.

00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:47.166
(laughs)

00:05:47.166 --> 00:05:51.125
David: That could be very challenging though,
particularly when it's just happened.

00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:53.875
There's so many different variables
in that for the person.

00:05:54.125 --> 00:05:58.375
Additionally, though, for the people
involved in that person's life.

00:05:58.666 --> 00:06:01.875
Some people come from very big families
and there's a lot of people

00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:04.125
who have a lot of different
input on that person.

00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:07.625
Some people come from smaller families
where there's maybe not as much of that.

00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:12.375
Kerry: That is a very difficult conversation
to have because it's upsetting

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:17.666
not to yourself, but also to your
loved ones to see all these changes

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.416
you're going through
and not knowing how to help.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.250
Anne: I think it's scares my husband.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:24.958
I think it scares my kid.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.875
It scares me a little bit, but I think
it scares them more than it scares me,

00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:33.125
maybe because I'm living it and it just
it is what it is.

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:35.041
And I hate that saying, but it is.

00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:36.000
(laughs)

00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.333
Kerry: I want to ask myself

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:40.500
what is the thing that I'm the most afraid of

00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:44.666
and then say, okay, now
how would I handle that?

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:47.625
And I think having a plan
and having a strategy

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
can really help one cope.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:54.916
Elaine: I was labeled DeafBlind even though
I still had some vision.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.500
I was completely blind
from my left eye.

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.375
This did bring about some adjustments

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.750
but I remained hopeful and
deeply connected to my identity

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.875
as a strong Deaf individual.

00:07:06.791 --> 00:07:10.625
Carl: Are things sometimes more of a challenge
than I would like them to be?

00:07:11.416 --> 00:07:15.250
Yes. But, you know what,
and I really believe this the older I get,

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.875
no one gets off Scot-free.

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:20.000
Everybody has challenges in the world.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Everybody has obstacles to overcome.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.166
Mine is just more visible
to people to watch and observe,

00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:27.625
but what sets people apart is how we

00:07:28.166 --> 00:07:30.375
overcome and deal with them.
