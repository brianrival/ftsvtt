00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.916
Rosanna: Advocacy really is
summed up in persistence.

00:00:07.916 --> 00:00:11.625
Your actions will speak
louder than words.

Lydia: We as a DeafBlind community have
so much to offer society.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.541
Rocky: We have to get ourselves integrated
into the society as much as possible.

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:26.666
Alice: And some of that is just being open

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.541
to the fact that we have the right to be.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.791
Rosanna: It is critical to become
your own advocate.

00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:38.625
Rocky: If I was not
an effective self-advocate,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.125
people would treat me like a rug.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.250
And indeed, that is true.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.000
Alice: You always feel

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.125
like somehow you're sliding
through the back door to get what you need

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:50.791
and itâ€™s tough to have to endure.

00:00:53.875 --> 00:00:55.041
Rocky: Hi my name is Rocky Hart.

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:56.625
Alice: My name is Alice Eaddy.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.000
Rosanna: Rosanna Beaudrie.

00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.666
Lydia: Lydia Olmstead.

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:03.583
A very critical piece of advocating
is being able to be

00:01:03.583 --> 00:01:06.916
a good thinker, a good problem solver,
and to be able to come up

00:01:06.916 --> 00:01:08.750
with alternative solutions.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.500
Rosanna: Know what your skills are,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.250
and promote those skills

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.250
so that you can be successful.

00:01:14.625 --> 00:01:15.750
Rocky: Societal attitudes

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.750
have really changed quite a bit.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.125
We're still not where we need to be.

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:20.375
We have a long ways to go.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.125
Alice: This is our life and
we should have the right to direct it

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:28.916
to some degree that's going to be
meaningful and make us feel proud.
