00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.416
David: People with disabilites tend to have
less absenteeism, less lateness,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
you know, they tend to
stay in positions longer.

00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:14.000
So they have attributes
that are positive for employers.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.875
We have data on that. That's a good thing.

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:20.250
So I think the employers that have studied
that know that

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:23.625
hiring people with disabilities
can be a good deal for them.

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:25.916
[music plays]

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.625
David: To disclose or not to disclose
and at what point to disclose.

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:38.416
Right? Because at some point,

00:00:38.416 --> 00:00:42.375
if you do get an offer and you show up
day one, whether it be virtual,

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.916
whether it be in-person
or some combination,

00:00:44.916 --> 00:00:47.500
they're going to know and you're going
to need to disclose at that point.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.916
So at what point in the process, at
what point do you put it on your resume?

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:54.000
How much do you allude to it?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.750
Korrine: For me it really has depended
on the job and the position.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.541
I've kind of done a variety
of either not disclosing

00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:05.208
until I get an interview and go in person,

00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:07.666
then it's kind of a given at that point,

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:11.625
my disability discloses itself
and I've also for other occasions

00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:15.250
I have kind of written ahead
like in a cover letter and would like

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:18.541
just put out a brief statement highlighting

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.500
my strengths and not my weaknesses.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.250
But most of the time I try to wait until

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.500
I at least get an interview
to kind of get my foot in the door

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.000
and then, you know, really drive home

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:32.625
I'm able to do these skills,
I'm able to do these tasks, you know.

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.916
Brian: You can really disclose at any point

00:01:34.916 --> 00:01:38.416
in the process. But in a cover
letter like Korrine mentioned,

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:42.541
or if it’s during the interview itself or

00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:46.750
even after you've been hired and you know,
before your first day of work.

00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:51.041
But I think it's really important
that you have your accommodations in place

00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:53.375
and ready to go before that
first day of work.

00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:57.166
And also when you do disclose,
you get all the protection of the ADA.

00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:02.125
That does not apply if you don't
decide to disclose to your employer.

00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:06.750
[music plays]

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:11.375
David: People with disabilities often face

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:15.750
the perception of low expectations
from people in their universe

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.500
or from their family or friends or,
you know, “Oh, it's great

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.375
that you could even just do this.”

00:02:21.666 --> 00:02:23.041
I wouldn't settle for that.

00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:25.500
It’s up to you, to what you want to do

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.250
you are the only ones who can
place limits on yourselfs.

00:02:28.416 --> 00:02:30.875
Brian: We do have to set higher expectations

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:34.875
of people with disabilities
and obviously there a range of disability

00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:38.291
and a range of expectations
but it's really important that

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:41.125
we set a higher bars for people.

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:43.375
Korrine: At the end of the day, you're in your own body,

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:46.000
you can decide what you can and can't do.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.875
You know your limits,
you know your strengths,

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:50.291
you know your weaknesses,
and you just have to go off of that.

00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:52.750
You can't go based off of what
somebody else says.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.625
David: Yeah, I agree. I agree.
And it comes, let's not

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.875
let people with disabilities
quote-unquote off the hook either.

00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:01.875
I mean, it needs talent
and you need to nurture that talent.

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:04.625
There's a reason why
everybody knows Ray Charles,

00:03:04.875 --> 00:03:06.375
because he's a great musician.

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:07.875
The same thing with Stevie Wonder

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:09.250
and keep going down the line, right?

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.000
So it definitely is up to people

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
with disabilities
to demonstrate that talent.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Brian: I also think networking
is really important.

00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:21.625
I know for my own personal experience,
getting to know people,

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.625
it really helps you down the road.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.375
Who knows, maybe there's a hiring
manager out there who is in your network

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.666
and may they'll help you find
a job or maybe they'll work

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:36.875
over your resume for you
and help you in any way that they can.

00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:41.375
And, you know, the more people
you get to know and who know you,

00:03:41.625 --> 00:03:43.541
the more likely you are to land a job.

00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:46.791
[music plays]

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.916
David: I remember, like some of
my first jobs the hiring managers

00:03:54.916 --> 00:03:57.750
or the manager, once I did
get hired ask me,

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.625
“Well, are you going to be able to do this?”
And invariably I would say yes,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.375
even not even knowing if I could do it,
I would just say yes.

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:08.500
And then, you know,
usually take it up with the supervisor.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.000
If I was running into a dilemma
or something like that,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.541
and then the supervisor level
is more apt to be able to try to problem

00:04:14.541 --> 00:04:17.625
solve with you and figure it out.
And only if it becomes

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:20.875
something that is intractable,
then I think it becomes an issue.

00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:22.750
And those have happened.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.291
But less than you might think.

00:04:24.291 --> 00:04:26.041
I think more often than not,

00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:30.625
the human condition takes over and people
want to help people to be successful.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.000
To me, it's all about

00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:34.500
having a positive attitude

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.875
because if you have
that positive attitude,

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:40.875
then you're more apt to keep going.
You're more apt to see the potential

00:04:40.875 --> 00:04:45.541
there as opposed to focusing on
the negative things or what can go wrong.

00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:49.375
Really, the only thing to worry about
is what you're worried about.

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:52.666
So why worry about things
that may never even happen?

00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:56.625
We suffer more...I think it was Seneca,
the great stoic philosopher,

00:04:56.625 --> 00:05:00.958
who said “We suffer more in
imagination than we do in reality.”

00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:06.291
Korrine: I think that being able to be
persistent in knowing your goals

00:05:06.291 --> 00:05:10.500
and knowing what you want
and really trying to take every effort

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.875
to get to that goal is really important.

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:17.750
You really need to keep pushing, keep
pushing, keep pushing for what you want,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.166
what you need to get,
and eventually you'll get there.

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:25.375
David: The path to prosperity is paved
by perseverance because it's not easy.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.291
It takes trial and error.

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:29.916
You got to hang in there.

00:05:29.916 --> 00:05:35.250
You got to be prepared to, again
have it be messed up 99 times

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.125
to have it work on that 100th time.

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:40.041
Let's focus on what we can control,

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:45.416
break the things down, set goals,
and we'll become what we think about.

00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:46.791
I’m just sure of it.

00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:48.208
