00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Rocky: Advocacy could have
several different definitions.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.750
Years ago, I had
a vocational rehabilitation

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.000
counselor who once told me that
if I was not an effective self-advocate,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.875
that people would treat me like a rug.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.250
And indeed, that is true.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.125
[music plays]

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.500
Rosanna: Advocacy is something
that's really important,

00:00:32.375 --> 00:00:36.625
especially if you are DeafBlind
or visually impaired.

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:41.750
It is different in terms of advocacy
for the community and for yourself.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.750
But they do both intertwine at some point.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.250
And I do feel that

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.375
it is critical to become
your own advocate.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:57.375
Alice: My definition of advocacy
is equally knowing what you want,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.125
what your needs are, but also knowing how

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:04.875
to convey it to people
that may not know what that is

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.250
in a way that's not going
to get their back up.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.916
And to help them be more willing
to provide such accommodations.

00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:17.416
Rocky: The thing with
DeafBlindness is that it's a very

00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:18.625
low incidence population.

00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:21.625
And so we're a very small community,
we're very close knit.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:25.250
And so when we're trying to go back out
into the hearing-sighted world

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.500
and people aren't always going to be
as understanding and in some cases

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.250
not as accommodating,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.666
we have to know how to explain our needs
and those things that we may not need.

00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:38.916
And so we have to advocate sometimes
in the blind community because

00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:40.375
there are significant differences

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.125
between blindness and DeafBlindness.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.500
Alice: I myself am the president of National
Federation DeafBlind Division, so...

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.125
advocating for the DeafBlind
within the National Federation

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:55.000
is part of what I do continuously.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.375
And sometimes it's just making them aware

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:02.750
that we still use the
same blindness skills.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.125
Mostly, some are different, but also

00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:10.250
the essence of us is...

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.375
...different.

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:13.375
You know, it's not insurmountable.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.750
It's just different.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.875
And so that's part of what
my role is as president.

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:22.250
It's also my role to try and find

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.250
ways that I can be helpful
in my own state,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.000
in my own community, at work.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.625
So it's cooperating, it's inventing,
sometimes it's just giving guidance

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.291
to what mediums really work for us

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.750
and trying to keep eliciting

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.625
an open door for conversation.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.375
Rosanna: It's interesting
that all of us agree that,

00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:52.750
you know, on the definition of advocacy
as knowing who you are,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
knowing your skills,
knowing what you want to do,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and, you know, advocating for
how are you going to do it.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.875
And I really agree

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:07.125
with what Alice has said
and Rocky as well.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:12.875
In being an active member of the American
Council of the Blind as well,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.916
a lot of the work that I do
is very similar to what Alice does

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.500
And one of the things that I was very much
involved in was the right to vote.

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.916
And when I say
the right to vote, it's not that

00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:29.000
blind people
didn't have the right to vote,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.500
but they didn't have the accessibility
to vote on their own.

00:03:33.875 --> 00:03:36.000
Getting that to the point where

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.750
a DeafBlind person
or visually impaired person

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:44.625
could walk up to a machine
and cast their vote privately.

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:47.125
And that's what advocacy
is really all about.

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:48.750
What Rocky said is really true.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.750
It's a very small type of community,
but that community needs to stick together

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.750
and work together because that community
is what supports each other

00:03:58.125 --> 00:04:01.625
to do their best and
put their best foot forward.

00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:05.000
[music plays]

00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:09.875
Rocky: It is still possible for

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.416
people with disabilities and
in the DeafBlind community to be isolated.

00:04:14.625 --> 00:04:17.500
That can happen through a lack of access
to communication,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.875
through a lack of access to technology.

00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:23.750
And I think what happens

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.625
a lot of times is when you create
the opportunities and the right attitudes

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:32.541
about advocacy and about DeafBlindness,

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:36.375
that will allow the DeafBlind community

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:40.375
to be rescued from the closet,

00:04:40.375 --> 00:04:45.000
so to speak, you
see that they will blossom.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.375
You see, once they're integrated,
I mean...

00:04:47.625 --> 00:04:51.500
the research on this too, has been,
you know, overwhelmingly stated

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.375
that when you integrate
people with disabilities

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.500
into the regular,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.250
the broader society,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.375
they do a lot better,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.250
their self-image
and self-esteem is improved.

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:07.625
And I can say for myself
that that's definitely the case.

00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:10.375
And I think that many other people
who are DeafBlind can say the same thing.

00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:12.625
So that's also a very important point.

00:05:12.625 --> 00:05:16.375
We have to get ourselves integrated
into the society as much as possible.

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:20.000
Alice: And some of that is just being open

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.500
to the fact that we have the right to be.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.125
You get the perception that it's
not our place to speak for ourselves.

00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:28.250
But from where I sit, it's not necessarily

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.000
But from where I sit, it's not necessarily

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.000
the place of sighted

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.750
people always to be our voice
because they're not living our experience.

00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:40.625
I like that they help me.

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:44.125
I like that they collaborate,
but like some of the things

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:47.375
that happen in the medical field,
if they don't know that we have a mind

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:49.750
and that we actually do
know what our bodies are doing

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.500
and that we are fully aware of

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
some illness or whatever
that they're continuing to ignore,

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.750
we still have problems.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.500
And I have found that
that in the medical realm especially

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.000
is very problematic, especially
if you don't have somebody else

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.375
that you can drag in
to be your voice and say,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
“Listen to her, she
knows what she's saying.”

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.000
Because if you come into my world,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.541
I'm gladly opening me to you, and
it doesn't feel that way the other way around.

00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:23.875
So you always feel

00:06:23.875 --> 00:06:28.125
like somehow you're sliding
through the back door to get what you need

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:33.750
and in this day and age,
it’s real tough to have to endure.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.250
