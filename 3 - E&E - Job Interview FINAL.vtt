00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.250
Korrine: I applied for probably well

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.416
over 80 jobs and had maybe six,

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.750
maybe seven interviews, some of which
were really positive experiences

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.875
and some of which were shocking

00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:18.875
as to how people respond.

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:22.250
They kind of don't really know

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.791
how to react.

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:26.500
[music plays]

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.666
Korrine: I would apply to a job that

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.125
I was very qualified for,

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:40.250
go for an interview,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.166
have a conversation, have that
interview, and then they'll be like,

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:47.250
‘Oh, we'll reach out.’
And then they never do.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.416
That kind of just gave me
the answer right there.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.250
You know, they just kind of
want to shut me out and that's it.

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:57.625
One woman in an interview
actually called me a hazard

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:00.291
because of my vision loss,
which is kind of...

00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:03.791
I was sitting there like, did
she actually just say that?

00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:04.875
Did I hear that right?

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:08.125
Did she said that, right?
And she just was like,

00:01:08.416 --> 00:01:12.375
“well, basically, I just don't see that
this job would be safe for you.”

00:01:13.916 --> 00:01:16.250
As customer service for a store?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.250
[laughter]

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.750
Linda: I went on this interview

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:23.125
and I was sitting at a desk.

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:26.625
The one lady really liked me,
but the other lady,

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.791
she was annoyed.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.250
I just got the impression that she didn't
want a blind-deaf person behind that desk.

00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:36.875
I really did.

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.375
And even the coach with me

00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:41.375
thought so.

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:43.500
And of course, I didn't get the job.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.875
David: What's the goal of a hiring manager?

00:01:45.916 --> 00:01:49.416
The goal of hiring manager is
to take that stack of 100 resumes

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.375
and pull the top six people out
so they can interview them

00:01:53.625 --> 00:01:55.500
and then during the interview process,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.625
find the person who really
is going to be best suited for that job.

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:02.791
Well, when you start talking,
any time there's that prefix ‘dis’

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:05.750
you know, that Latin,
which means the lack of.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.375
All of a sudden the hiring managers,
what they're programed to do

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:13.000
is to not take the
person who lacks anything.

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:15.000
Chris: It's challenging, honestly,

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.750
for DeafBlind people
to begin their journey

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.041
in employment, to just get onto
to the first rung of the ladder.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:26.083
Just getting that grip on the first
rung is a challenge.

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:28.000
And you might wonder,
why is that challenging?

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:31.000
Well, it's for a myriad reasons.

00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:34.458
One is people's perspective
that DeafBlind people

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:36.291
can't work, simply can't work.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.541
And that's not accurate.

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:41.750
[music plays]

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.875
Korrine: During one of the other interviews,

00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:52.041
when we were discussing
different positions at the job,

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:58.000
they pretty much wanted to decide for me
what I could and could not do,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.875
which was not their decision.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.500
That's up to me.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.500
I know what I'm capable of.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.791
I know what I can, what I can't do.

00:03:07.791 --> 00:03:09.250
And I'm very comfortable saying that.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.125
I know my strengths, I know my weaknesses.

00:03:11.125 --> 00:03:12.625
I know what I have to work on.

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:15.500
Now I'm a person with a
disability and I'm capable

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.791
of working a job and doing stuff
just like anybody else is.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.500
I did a lot of training to get
to where I am with those skills

00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:24.416
and it was very frustrating

00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:27.250
because I didn't feel like
they were really listening.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.291
Linda: We try so hard, you know, to learn
and to be able to do the job.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.041
Just give us a chance.

00:03:34.041 --> 00:03:38.666
If it doesn't work out, then it doesn't
work out, go home and cry your eyes out.

00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:40.875
That's what bugs me.

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:42.041
You know, that really bugs me

00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:46.000
that there are people out there
that won't give us a chance.

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:47.625
Shame on them.

00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:50.291
You know, shame on them.

00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:52.625
David: It comes down to having people

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:55.875
understand that with a
reasonable accommodation

00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:59.375
with reasonably modifying
the way a job is done,

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.416
call it job crafting or job carving
or however you want to term it,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.750
really just making some
adjustments to be able to use

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.500
the great skills that people
with disabilities bring to the table

00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:16.541
that somebody without a disability
may not necessarily have.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.500
Whether it's the intestinal fortitude

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.041
of being able to cross a busy
intersection blindfolded essentially,

00:04:22.291 --> 00:04:26.291
or the problem solving that goes
into figuring out how to do things

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.375
that were made and
envisioned for sighted people,

00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:32.125
as somebody who doesn't have that vision.

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:35.375
So I think those are all attributes that

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:38.375
once you can illuminate people to that,

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:41.916
once you can provide that education,
then I think they can appreciate that,

00:04:41.916 --> 00:04:45.625
wait a minute, we actually
might have something here that

00:04:46.125 --> 00:04:48.625
is valuable and that we can use,

00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:51.250
whether it be in the employment
context or some other way.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.750
Chris: Some DeafBlind people
aren't positive that they can do it.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.875
They have that feeling that,
“well, maybe I can't.”

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.166
Who has engrained that
thought process into your head?

00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:05.375
Who has planted
that seed that you're not able to?

00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:09.625
And I think it's society as a whole
that have been telling us

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:14.625
as deaf people that we can't,
and then we internalize and live that

00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:20.291
self-fulfilling prophecy of ‘I can't.’
And all of that is wrong.

00:05:21.916 --> 00:05:24.000
Korrine: One piece of advice
I would give an employer

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
who hasn't had that experience
with a disabled individual

00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:31.875
is probably, you know,
be open, listen to them.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.416
Listen to what they have to say.

00:05:34.416 --> 00:05:35.791
Hear them out.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.250
Give them that chance.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.250
Because everyone deserves that chance.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.250
Everyone deserves an equal opportunity.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.375
Don't make that assumption.

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:49.625
Don't assume somebody can or
can't do something because of a quote-unquote label.

00:05:49.875 --> 00:05:51.750
And I don't like calling it that.

00:05:52.416 --> 00:05:55.750
But that's what the world,
for the most part sees this as.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.625
And there's so much stigma
and so many misconceptions

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:03.125
and so many assumptions
that people make that,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.916
you know, you really need to break down
those barriers and be more open

00:06:08.375 --> 00:06:09.416
to understanding.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.875
David: I’d ask everybody to consider providing
access to opportunites, right?

00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:17.000
It’s one thing to provide an opportunity.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.625
Even more basic than that is
providing access to that opportunity.

00:06:20.875 --> 00:06:24.666
That’s really all I think that
people with disabilities are asking for,

00:06:24.666 --> 00:06:28.375
ultimately is, “Just give me an opportunity,
give me access to that opportunity.”

00:06:28.375 --> 00:06:34.583
There’s so much talent in the 12% to 20%
of the population that are people with disabilites.

00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:36.250
Let’s access that talent.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.500
