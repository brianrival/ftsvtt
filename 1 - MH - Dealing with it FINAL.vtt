00:00:03.125 --> 00:00:05.166
Rebecca: I knew that two of my biggest fears

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.291
were of going deaf and of going blind.

00:00:07.666 --> 00:00:10.166
Our instinct is to avoid that,
to run away from that,

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:14.291
whether it's just to distract ourselves
with any number of different things.

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:19.625
And at some point in sort of
that inner wrestling with myself,

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:22.791
I realized that if those
are my two biggest fears,

00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:26.791
then that actually is exactly
what I need to face head on.

00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:31.000
[music plays]

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:38.250
Korrine. So when I first started
losing my vision, that was probably

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.166
during the beginning of high school.

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:43.625
Getting adjusted to a whole new school,
getting adjusted to making new friends,

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:47.541
new classes, new environment,
that's stressful as it is.

00:00:47.916 --> 00:00:50.500
And then starting to lose your vision,

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.083
which is a sense that a lot of people,
I think, take for granted.

00:00:55.083 --> 00:00:56.416
It was a really tough adjustment

00:00:56.416 --> 00:00:59.750
to try and, one process
and try to understand

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:04.875
and it's also a part of trying
to go through a grief cycle as well,

00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:09.750
because growing up sighted
and then gradually losing this

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.791
piece of you that you've had
your whole life up until that point.

00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:18.708
Also taking into consideration
the hearing loss, it gets so fatiguing.

00:01:18.708 --> 00:01:21.375
You had to relearn how to do a lot

00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:26.416
and learn how to navigate
and learn how to cope with the feelings

00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:28.708
of losing your vision and

00:01:28.708 --> 00:01:32.041
being able to handle it
in a safe and respectful way.

00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:36.000
Rebcca: To be going
progressively deaf and blind

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.750
the initial feeling is that
I am being taken from my world,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.416
that I'm not the same,
that everybody is able to do

00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:47.000
all of these things that I am
progressively no longer able to do.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.041
And what I always felt was just
a sense of not really belonging.

00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:55.625
Like, I felt like there was something
fundamentally wrong with me because

00:01:55.625 --> 00:02:01.416
developmentally I couldn't really wrap
my head around what was happening to me.

00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:02.916
This was before my diagnosis,

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:06.041
and then when I was officially
diagnosed with Usher syndrome.

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:09.416
And what I realized along the way is that

00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.750
it's not so much the physical implications
of going deaf and blind.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.291
It's the emotional, it's
the social implications of losing

00:02:19.291 --> 00:02:21.500
two of your most vital senses.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.625
[music plays]

00:02:27.458 --> 00:02:31.000
Korrine: When I was going through that period,
I ended up losing a lot of my friends

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.583
because everyone
kind of saw me as different.

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:36.750
I think it was kind of
intimidating for them.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.125
I think it was scary for them.

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:40.625
Of course, they didn't know what
to expect and neither did I.

00:02:40.875 --> 00:02:43.125
But it hurt.

00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:47.166
It was something that kind of
was like a turning point in my life

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:50.375
I ended up having to get
taken out of public school

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:53.000
because they weren't providing me
with the accommodations that I needed

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.875
and I ended up getting
placed with a tutor one-on-one

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:59.041
where I was able to have more customized

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:02.750
curriculum to have that person be able

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.750
to read to me, to be able to have a CCTV
and other assistive technology.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.375
Trying to take in all of that information

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:12.541
and feedback and absorb it and process it

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.625
and be able to understand
it clearly has been really difficult.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.000
So just kind of

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.916
dealing with a dual sensory
loss is not an easy thing.

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:23.625
Rebecca: Your needs are evolving and changing

00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:26.750
and so then having to ask someone
for what you need

00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:30.291
when you're not even comfortable
with having those needs

00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:34.166
or having new needs,
it can be really difficult.

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:37.375
But I think this underlying very,
very common theme

00:03:37.375 --> 00:03:41.541
for people with disabilities
is this fear of being a burden.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.500
And so I think it's that underlying
theme of being a burden

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.500
that really is pervasive
through so many of the lives of people

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.166
I work with with disabilities.

00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:55.875
And the other thing is suppressed anger.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.875
And I think there's a lot of anger
that becomes self-imposed

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:07.125
because of the way that they were treated
or the way that they were raised

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:11.625
to believe they should be,
that they're not.

00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:15.791
Korrine: Having that thought process of,
“am I good enough to have a partner?”

00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:18.000
you know, “will I have friends?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.416
will I be successful and have a job?

00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:23.291
Can I graduate college?”
Just a lot of that

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:27.500
was really hard to process.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.541
You have to feel the emotions
to move past it.

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:34.916
You can't just kind of latch on
or just push it away.

00:04:34.916 --> 00:04:37.000
You go through acceptance,
you go through denial.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You just need to learn how to cope.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.625
And learn how to move
through those phases.

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:45.375
And it's not easy,
I'll be honest with that.

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:49.875
It was something that I really struggled
with, especially being a young adult

00:04:49.875 --> 00:04:53.041
going through enough
as it is growing up and trying

00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:55.000
to figure out your place in the world.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.250
[music plays]

00:05:00.916 --> 00:05:03.250
Korrine: A person who has a disability,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.625
you're always going to assume that
this isn't someone I could ask for help.

00:05:07.625 --> 00:05:10.041
This is certainly not somebody
I could lean on for support.

00:05:10.041 --> 00:05:12.875
How can I lean on this person?
Look at all that they're dealing with.

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:16.000
And that is ableism.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.041
That is ableism at its finest.

00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:22.125
Assuming that someone,
because they have a disability,

00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:25.166
that they are suffering,
that they are incapable,

00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:29.375
that they can't be burdened because
look at the burden they already carry.

00:05:29.666 --> 00:05:32.416
So all of those ways
in which ableism plays out

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:36.750
is certainly a major part of
the world that we live in.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.250
Internalized ableism is when
you go out in the world...

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.250
It's all of those years that I spend of
feeling like it was not acceptable

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.375
for me to be anything
but sighted and hearing.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.125
And that to be anything but sighted
and hearing meant that I was incapable.

00:05:56.125 --> 00:06:02.125
Internalized ableism is that need to conform

00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:06.250
to being as hearing and sighted,
as able-bodied as possible

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.500
because that's the only
socially acceptable way to be.

00:06:09.791 --> 00:06:14.000
And so all of these insidious
ways that it manifests itself,

00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:17.791
in whether it's trying to make
myself likable to somebody

00:06:17.791 --> 00:06:19.041
who doesn't have a disability

00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:23.291
so that they can feel like non-threatened
or not intimidated by me.

00:06:23.291 --> 00:06:27.666
And so how do we start to reframe
the way that we view ourselves

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.375
and then reframe how other people see
people with disabilities?

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:36.291
But that internalized ableism,
I think is something that

00:06:36.416 --> 00:06:40.250
we all have to develop a relationship with

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.875
and an understanding of
in order to be able

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:47.625
to come to terms with ourselves
as people with disabilities.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.333
